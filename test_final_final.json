I recommend shooting with this lens on a full frame body. The length is perfect, but also the ISO sensitivity is much better on full frame bodies. Copy and paste the link inside the brackets. I shot this image at F/2.The macro on this lens is the standard fare of all lenses. I would recommend pairing this up with some Kenko extension tubes. You can buy them on Amazon for $199.

I don't know how to explain it in tech terms, but basically, PFC power supplies which are high quality, require a real sinewave power supply.

After researching and listening to as many speakers as I could at local dealers, I settled on the Polk Audio DB6501. They happened to be on sale at the time and fell right in to my price range.I installed these speakers myself into my sound treated doors (RoadKill Sound Deadening material) and sealed the adapotor into place with window sealant.These treatments helped bring out the bass significantly, and I'll get to that in the following sections. For the price, these speakers deliver! The highs are clear and the bass is clean. Mid range gets a bit muddled.Tweeters:As I stated above, the tweeters deliver a nice clear, well rounded sound. May even sound too bright at first, however the supplied crossover has a built-in attenuator that helps. While they do sound bright, out of the box hooked up to my Pioneer head unit, a flat EQ delivers lack luster sound a heavily rolled off highs. Sounds lifeless. Had a hard time tuning these speakers. And perhaps that has more to do with the Head Unit then the speakers themselves, however the same head unit paired with a higher quality speaker (such as my previous Boston Pro 60's) had no trouble and required very little EQ correction. The best sound I've been able to get out of these speakers was surprising though my Nexus 5 over Bluetooth using Viper Audio.The biggest problem I had with the tweeters is clipping. Regardless of volume, both tweeters clip on certain piano, flute and electronica passages. The best example of clipping was the dripping sound effects at the start of Look at Me Now by Lil Wayne. This happened on both the stock head unit and after installing the Pioneer.Woofers:The woofers are solid for their price point. Bass sounds great, however it lacks in volume. Not a problem if you have a decent subwoofer system, preferable a sealed sub. The midrange over shadows the bass greatly and usually comes off muddy. Some EQ helps but music that has a lot of electric guitars suffers the most from this problem. However music with little mid range, such as electronica, R&B; and rap, sound fantastic, naturally because there are little midrange there to overshadow the bass. After about 14 months my right woofer started to cut out and over the course of a month went out completely. Some part inside the woofer that created the connection between the magnet and the cone failed. Although I was out of warranty, I called Polk and told them about my problem. The sent me a prepaid UPS label and told me to ship it to them. I did and 5 days later a brand new woofer came back. Popped it in and was back in business. So huge kudos to Polk's fantastic customer service!OverallFor a great value and decent sound quality and plenty of volume (they can play very loud without any problems, aside from the persistent problems like the twitter clipping and lack of quality mid range). The are a great upgrade to a factory system and a good foot in the door to car audio if your on a budget.I just ordered the Polk MM6501 from Amazon to upgrade from the DB6501.Previously Owned Door Speakers:- Boston Acoustics Pro 60- Focal (Mid-Range class; 10 Years ago)- Alpine Type S CoaxialPros:Price! Price! Price! Absolutely the best bang for buck in their class.Power Hungry and Bullet Proof.Ease of installation. All the brackets are included to make install a breezeCustomer Service from Polk is fantastic.Cons:Mid range suffers the most in this speaker.Tweeter Clips on some passages.Much EQ is needed to dial these speakers to their potential.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A Seasoned Review: DB6501's After 2 Years", "unixReviewTime": 1395532800, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2014"}

It worked but it took some modifying and purchasing of additional parts to make it fully functional.The main issue is the size of the 5mm screws included to attach the TV to the frame. They're smaller than the holes drilled into the frame. There are included lock washers that slightly increase the diameter but they can still easily slip through the frame with even the tiniest bit of shifting. I don't want my TV face down on the floor, so I ended up going out and buying some washers. Easy fix but still, the manufacturer should be able to foresee this being an issue. Did they even demo this bracket before selling it? Apparently not.The next issue is the lock screws on the bottom of the TV portion of the frame. The wall bracket attaches to the wall and there is a separate piece that attaches to the television, which then hangs on the wall bracket via two hooks. There is a screw on each side of the bottom of this latter piece that keeps it locked to the bracket, preventing accidental lifting of the TV. The television part tilts slightly to allow you to angle the TV down; however, if you angle it down, it prevents you from getting to the screw that locks it into the bracket. Basically, there is no way for me to secure the TV to the wall bracket. Luckily, we don't have large pets,kids, or live in an earthquake zone so this shouldn't be an issue but it could definitely cause a problem for others.All in all, it works okay but I'd recommend you seek a better designed bracket. I certainly would not buy it again.Update: While the mount is not so fantastic, Cheetah Mounts' customer service is amazing. Apparently, the issues I experienced with the mount were a known issue and had been fixed; however, it appears I received one of the old models. They contacted me asking for feedback and helped me out with another wall mount that suits my needs and won't destroy my TV if we have an earthquake.

Ported to the rear, they have great depth when in a corner of a room. I also use a rocketfish wireless speaker adapter to run the rears. Which was a concern of mine when buying these, that the sound quality or ability of the rocketfish to run them would be lacking. This is not the issue at all. They still sound great!

I can wear them for 12 hours without discomfort. The ear cups no longer push the foam onto your ear, it's pushed back more and a little bit bigger so it cups your entire ear without touching the outer leather like cushions as the 280's did.One gripe I have is they do not sit well around the neck. Sennheiser could easily have fixed this by allowing the ear cups to fold all the way out at 180 degrees so the speakers face out which is good for if you want to still listen to music or audio and hear your sounds around you such as 7.1 dolby audio work.Overall these are superior headphones and under $150 are definitely worth the purchase.

While not a professional, I'm becoming much more critical of my work and demanding higher quality. As a result, I'm finding myself looking at prosumer equipment to feed the need. Now that I've gotten the fact that I'm a wannabe photographer out of the way let's get on with the review, one that won't repeat the technical specifications that can be found under the, wait for it, technical specifications section of this page.A while back I wrote a review for the Nikon 70-300mm lens. While I love the lens for outdoor sports it left a lot to be desired for indoor sports photography. As such, I started the research process for a lens that would without breaking the bank. It didn't take long to see that the Nikon 70-200mm F2.8 lens came highly recommended. While much more than I wanted to originally spend, I figured I'd take the plunge and start saving for it. After collecting from football parents and saving for a few months I ordered the lens.Upon delivery the first thing I noticed was the size of the box. After the unboxing ceremony I noticed how the lens dwarfed my 70-300mm lens. Not only did it dwarf it, it outweighed it. But the weight was a good weight, if that makes any sense. The build of this lens screams quality and the golden band confirms it! The only plastic you'll find on this lens is on the lens caps, front and back and the lens hood. The zoom and focus rings are made of a rubber material that doesn't cheapen the look of the lens. The recurring theme for this lens is metal, metal and metal.After a quick inspection for defects I slapped on the B+W UV filter and attached the lens to the camera, a Nikon D7000. Hey, I'm saving for an FX variant as I type this review. With the lens attached and firmly in hand the first impression was how will I shoot a venue with this behemoth around my neck? After powering up the camera, I threw her in manual mode and pressed the shutter release button with the lens cap on. The lens flew through the focal lengths. For comparison I placed the 70-300mm lens on and repeated the process. While the 70-300mm lens performed adequately, there was no comparison between the two. The 70-200mm lens stole the show. I then removed the lens cap, found a few subjects and shot away.After downloading the photos to my computer for evaluation I was pleasantly surprised. But come to think of it I should not have been. After all, the reviews I read earlier should have primed me for the performance of the lens. I was satisfied with 85% of the shots I took. The 15% that didn't make the cut were not due to the lens. It was a result of poor composition, blah subjects, etc.The past few months since purchasing have been spent really learning the lens. To get the most out of it and minimize editing, I've modified my camera's presets to produce a more vivid photo straight from the camera. Once the sweet spot is found, the shooting experience is enhanced. Colors pop and the contrast brings a natural sense of complexity and depth to photos.Since purchasing the lens I've taken photographs of a youth basketball team and my son's wrestling team. Some gyms were well lit and other's not so much. With my camera's shutter firing at 1/400 an ISO of 2500 and an aperture of F2.8, I'm getting many more keepers. However, I have noticed that if I'm shooting basketball from the sidelines the lens can be a little long on a DX camera. While I may not capture as much of the scene as I would with my 50mm 1.8G or a wider angle lens, my next purchase, what you do capture will be razor sharp and crystal clear.Bottom line, if you're looking for a fast lens that allows you to shoot in low light environments pick this one up. I'm a happy camper and so are my customers. She's definitely a keeper.Oh, by the way, I've gotten over the weight.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Perfect for Low Light Indoor Sports", "unixReviewTime": 1395273600, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2014"}

{"reviewerID": "A1ZIXV984GLYD9", "asin": "B002XVBAKI", "reviewerName": "11bravo", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "For those with limited time, see summary at bottom.Have had an Asus O!Play mini for 3 years, so am used to all of its features.  You plug it in, it works; have used on a good number of tv's (home, friends, travel).  But no longer produced, nor sold, so when I wanted another one for the bedroom's tv, had to look elsewhere.  I know Asus, and Micca, you are NO Asus.Plugged Micca in, powered it on, connection via hdmi.  It went through its initial setup fine, though tv reported received input was 720p.  Tv 1080p so went to Micca video menu, set its output to 1080p.  TV reported 1080p received.  Played several videos from a usb flash drive.  All well and good.  Given both the Asus and the Micca use the same Realtek 1055 chip, the Micca plays a LOT of video types, MANY more than a tv or blu-ray usb connection will.But then, made the HORRIBLE mistake of turning the Micca off.  Powered back on; it never got past its boot screen of the Micca logo.  TV reported received resolution as 720p.  30 seconds later, tv reported no signal, then 30 seconds later, a 480p signal with the EVER present Micca logo.  Repeated every 30 seconds:  no signal, 480p Micca logo, no signal, 480p logo...  A non-satisfactory solution was to unplug (as in NO power) the Micca for an hour, then plug back in.  Then it would work again until next time powered off (but left plugged in).  Still, order WAS important:  first you had to power on Micca, then tv, THEN plug in hdmi cable to Micca.  If tv was off, or Micca powered on with hdmi cable connected, would not work.  Perhaps clicking heels together 3 times while saying \"I wish you were an Asus\" also helped; regaining a functional player never a sure thing.Full disclosure:  I had these problems when connecting the Micca via hdmi to the \"purchased for\" location of the bedroom's Seiki tv (a no-name, off brand for sure, but has a good picture and is 1080p).  Another review, \"HDMI Issues with Samsung TV, March 4, 2014\", by Dylan Rothman, reported similar problem with a Samsung tv.  Will say, when Micca connected via hdmi to the living room's LG, Micca functioned as expected, except for the problem of several of its buttons also operating the (non-Micca) blu-ray player (Micca's return powers blu-ray on/off, Micca's setup opens/closes blu-ray tray).  While setup button is not generally KNOWINGLY pressed, return button is frequently used.  Never have had that problem with the NUMEROUS other remotes I have.  The Asus O!Play mini has NO problems with either of these tv's, no problems with Toshiba tv's, or several other no name brands found in various hotels, both foreign and domestic.  Asus remote has never inadvertently controlled other devices.--------For those brave enough to try, the Micca remote is proof that more is NOT more.  Excluding the [left, right, up, down, OK] navigation buttons (common to both Micca and Asus remotes), the Micca remote has an additional 26 SMALL dedicated buttons; the Asus has 16 dedicated on the SAME size of remote.  Guess which is easier to use in a dimly lit room?The rationale for some of the Micca's TOP-LEVEL buttons, rather than being implemented as menu/sub-menu options as in the Asus, is beyond me; e.g., buttons for Tv system (cycle 480p, 720p, 1080i, 1080p resolutions), Repeat and A-B buttons for setting repeat clips, Setup button (it also has a top-level Home button that with a sub-menu selection will take you to setup), Av output type (Composite or Component)...  All add to \"congestion\" on the remote for functions that should RARELY be used.  Menu/sub-menu, rather than dedicated buttons, much more user friendly for seldom used functions.Having said that, 2 added buttons on the Micca are appreciated:1.  A dedicated Subtitle button (also reached by Option button, then sub-menu, on both Micca and Asus remotes).  But a dedicated, top level button appreciated by those of us who watch a number of foreign videos.2.  Another addition is capability for slow motion via a dedicated button (sequential pushes provide 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 speeds).A display button very useful (same as Asus's info button) to provide a VISUAL representation of where you are in the file (thick line for what's played, thin line for remaining), along with numeric data (elapsed time, total time), audio and video codecs in file, etc.  Useful in deciding to finish video, or stop and resume (another VERY useful feature) next day.  What's not so useful is its position on the Micca - sandwiched between other buttons, rather than on the Asus, where it's easily found given the wider spacing and user friendly layout.Another advantage of the Micca is that it does sort folders/files as a human would expect (alphabetically), while the Asus uses \"computer programer mode\" for FAT32 drives, displaying files in order as found in the drive's FAT table, no sorting (on your computer, windows provides the sort for explorer), though there are free software programs to \"correctly\" sort those files on a drive before moving to the Asus (useful for say 64gb flash drives, would not like to do on a 1TB drive...)  NTFS drives don't have this problem.Finally, the Micca has 2 usb ports (his and hers?) compared to the Asus's 1 usb port.  Positioning is different:  Micca's ports are on its sides (usb on 1, SD card on the other), while the Asus has its ports in front.  Depending on your location, each has its advantages/disadvantages.  Micca's may be a bit awkward to get to if it's in a low bay; Asus doesn't have that problem.  On the other hand, a usb drive does protrude from the Asus, a problem the Micca doesn't have.--------SUMMARYI wanted to like the Micca, I really did.  But I'm not a gambler.  While the Micca MIGHT work on YOUR tv, it only works on 50% of mine.  I certainly DON'T want to be carrying along something that might/might not work when I visit a friend or travel, and it does NOT work on its target tv in MY home.  Perhaps a FUTURE firmware fix might fix the problem (just in case, installed the most recent, as of now, version, 11-2013).  Micca still does not reliably work on all tv's.  SAME problems described above.Back it goes; THANKS, Amazon, it's why I buy from you.=========WORKAROUND for hdmi hang in Micca logo:  During initial setup, it'll work, so manually set correct video resolution via video menu.  After initial setup, when put into standby, and it won't start again, just hangs with Micca logo screen:  it's trying to connect at 480p, will ENDLESSLY wait for tv response it can understand, which will never happen.  Leave Micca player on, leave tv on, then unplug hdmi cable from player, then plug hdmi cable back in.  This sends a hotplug detect signal over hdmi's pin 19 to player, allowing player to finish boot and enter home menu.=========5/12/14:  LIVABLE workaround for HDMI hang (no cable unplugging required):1.  To prevent problem from occurring:  Make sure TV is off BEFORE powering on Micca.  Wait AT LEAST 10 seconds AFTER powering Micca player on BEFORE powering TV on.  Micca will successfully boot into home (top level) menu.2.  If you're in the Micco logo \"hang\" (Micca logo displayed for more than a couple of seconds, nothing else happens; remote's keys don't work, not even the power button), then turn TV off.  Wait AT LEAST 10 seconds, THEN turn TV on.  Micca will successfully boot into home (top level) menu.10 second WAIT is CRITICAL.  Any quicker, and hang is not cleared.Be advised it can take the Micca player 5-6 seconds to actually turn off after Micca remote's power button is pressed (power light on player goes from on=blue to standby=red).  Easiest is to turn player off FIRST, keeping TV on.  TV will report \"no signal\" as Micca starts its \"off procedure\" so you will know it's successfully shutting down.Hopefully, a firmware fix for the HDMI hang problem will be provided.

So when I was forced to return to the stone age of DSL, there was no question in buying TP-Link. I certainly wasn't going to use a Century modem. As usual, the modem/router combo has outperformed all expectations, and has managed to eke out some quality performance out of sub-par DSL service. I don't have normal television. I use an antenna for local stations and stream the rest thanks to Roku3 and Amazon Fire TV. I'm also a full time doctoral student where I spend most of my time digging through LexisNexis like databases. Both of these chores require a quality internet connection. So you can understand my apprehension of having to return to DSL.But, the TP Link's dual band has managed my demands well. Both Roku3 and Amazon Fire are streamed on the higher end of the 5.0ghz band, while the rest of the household items (4 Laptops, 2 Smartphones, 2 tablets, DVD player, laser printer) are running on the lower 2.4ghz band. Surprisingly I've not encountered any buffering issues with streaming--though at peak hours I have found internet surfing to be extremely slow--no surprise there really, and this is not due to the router/modem.Set-up was simple-ish in a manner of speaking. Powering on, plugging in, and connecting to the router was a breeze...It was mostly CenturyLink who was the problem. First off let me be clear, YES this modem and any DSL rated modem WILL work with CenturyLink service. Do not let a representative tell you otherwise. What they will tell you is if you do not choose a modem/router on their list, the will not provide technical support--big deal, I don't need them too. But here is what you will need from Century, and you need to be firm and clear in this demand.When you call CenturyLink tell them you need the following information:1. Username and Password--don't be surprised if the tech gives you the run around and says \"let me try linking to your modem first...\" just say there is no need to you already know what the problem is.

According to my tvfool report, most of what I'm getting is 2edge, meaning everything is bouncing off of multiple obstructions.Just for laughs, I tried a Mohu Leaf Ultimate, since it advertises up to 50 mile signal reception.  I got one station badly and saw unusable signal on two others.  Fortunately bought at a B&M; store so it was an easy return.I then tried one of the compact &#34;lava&#34; antennas sold under 800 names, with an included amp and two way splitter.  This surprised me by pulling in all of the UHF channels, but it was useless for my application with the VHF Hi stations.  Its definitely a decent UHF antenna, but you'd better have short distance and something close to LOS for the VHF stations.The HBU44 was recommended to me by solidsignal.  Its a long antenna but has narrow elements.  I really wanted an attic mount because my roof would be challenging to install on and where my house is positioned is prone to extremely high winds at various times through the year.  Its a perfect attic antenna.  While quite long at about 11-12', its in two sections easily joined and all the longer elements snap in and out without much trouble, just a tab and swivel.  It went into my small attic opening and I extended the wide elements as I went and then snapped the two that go up and down into place after positioning the antenna between the rafters.  It weighs 9lbs, so easy to hang or mount to a small post or tripod.  In my case it just laid into the rafters and didn't need a hanger.Solidsignal told me I'd probably have to put the antenna outside, and in my first experiment I got all the channels but with low signal levels on a few.  The Lava antenna actually got better numbers on a few of the higher UHF channels, but the HBU44 got the elusive VHF Hi signals for me.  I added a Wingard LNA-200 amp from Amazon and that snapped another 15-20 points of signal into all the channels and made them very solid.  I'm getting high 80's to mid 90's for signal level.  The antenna pulled in about 35 channels during the day and went to 60 in the evening.  Daytime reception can be much more difficult than night time reception.The only two downsides to this antenna are that it doesn't receive VHF-Lo channels, which is how it gets to be so compact as the VHF-Lo elements are the really wide ones on some antennas that support those channels, and they shipped the antenna covered in what looks like that silver greasy stuff you put on your nose in the summer to keep it from getting sunburned.  I was covered in the stuff by the time I was done with the install.Highly recommended for difficult attic installs in problematic reception areas, providing you've looked at an antenna web site like antennaweb or tvfool and determined that your stations are either UHF or VHF-Hi.  I think I'd go with a DB4 if all my stations were UHF.  Price is also a consideration, as this antenna was less expensive than others that might have done the job and many of those have either wider elements, elements that can't be retracted once snapped into place, or are much longer.If you aren't as far away or have better line-of-sight, you can go with the HBU33.  If you have more room in the attic and a larger budget, the HBU55 might work.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great attic antenna, pulls in some tough stations", "unixReviewTime": 1400976000, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2014"}

Having tried Cherry Blues and disliking them on another keyboard, I decided to get the Das Keyboard and try out Browns. So as it turns out, I do not like Cherry Browns either. There's just a gritty feeling with Cherry switches that isn't pleasant to me. Keep in mind my daily keyboard has been an IBM Model M for years. I needed to buy a new keyboard that had USB support to use with a KVM as they don't make one with PS/2 connectors like my old IBM use.The keys feel nice being blank, but the ABS texture if you've ever felt PBT just isn't as nice (Model M's use PBT keycaps, feel a bit more textured to the touch). While I'm totally able to type without looking at the keys, having a blank keyboard is a bit gimmicky. I was frustrated a few times when playing a game which uses a key on the right hand side of the keyboard for some less frequently used function in the game. When you're playing a game, it's nice to be able to just glance down for a second to make sure you're hitting the right key. For pure typists, blanks might be fine but if you game I'd recommend getting one with printed keycaps. Blanks really aren't as cool as you think.The other big thing that I despised about the Das Keyboard - glossy finish. As someone who frequently rests their palms between typing on the front lip of the keyboard, I detest the feel of a glossy plastic finish. I also sometimes rest my left hand on the left edge of the keyboard. Coming from an IBM Model M where everything is very textured, thick plastic - the thin slick feel of the Das is just hugely uncomfortable to me. Being a clean freak I constantly was wiping the edges of the keyboard down with the included cleaning cloth. Some might be fine with a glossy finish, but I had no idea how glossy it was and it smudges extremely easily.Overall a well built keyboard, but between my apparent dislike of Cherry switches, the blank keys, and the glossy finish this keyboard just really wasn't for me. I ended up spending even more and ordered a Topre Realforce with all 55g weighted keys and I would strongly recommend a Topre switch over Cherry switches. In this price range, I think a Type Heaven would be a much better choice. Topres cost more, but are totally worth it for something you type on every day. If you just can't spring for a Topre, you'd be better off to just buy a cheaper Cherry based keyboard from someone like Cooler Master as they have a thinner lip around the keyboard, have a non-gloss finish, and have good build quality. The Das is a bit overpriced for what you get. Of course a Model M is an excellent keyboard assuming you can use PS/2 and don't mind the old school looks and loud keys (Honestly I think it sounds pleasant, in contrast to Cherry Blues which I find way to clacky and plastic sounding), and you can buy one for a fraction of the cost of even cheap new Cherry boards. I love my Topre, but I will never let go of my Model M.Update 4/4/2014: Seems that the makers of Das Keyboard realized the glossy finish was unappealing to a lot of folks like myself, new version of the Das Keyboard is now matte finish. I think this keyboard would resolve most of the issues I had with the Das. The price is a bit high for what you get though, as I don't think the Das does anything especially better than some of the cheaper mechanical keyboards.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "A decent but overrated keyboard", "unixReviewTime": 1395705600, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2014"}

I quickly learned 2 Major negatives on this and wished I would have spent the extra few bucks for the Canon brand remote.1. The range is WEAK. For a wide group photo I placed the camera probably 15' away, and attempted to click the remote.  Nothing.  i walked closer and closer trying and trying it, until I was probably 10' away (which IS the stated range in the specs, I just didn't pay attention to that when I bought it) So I clicked the remote and ran back to the crowd and had to try a few times since the camera was on the 2 second timer. I could have put it on the 10 second timer, but it's hard to know when to tell everyone to smile.  So I immediately bought the canon version for literally $3 more on the market place here. It came in yesterday and although they claim their range to be 16' - it goes past 16 feet. I maxed out my room at about 20' and it worked.2. It won't immediately trigger the shutter.  The main reason we purchased the remote was so we could take our own family pics on our MK III without paying a hundred bucks every time we needed family photos.  and with our 3 kids it's hard to get them to hold a pose, so I thought great, I'll just actuate the shutter the moment we get them all smiling and looking ahead.  Not on the Amazon version, all it does is activate the timer so the minimum is 2 seconds on my MKIII.  The canon version actuates immediately which is what I need.  If I wanted to just trigger the 10 second timer I could do that and walk out to the group and try to coordinate the cute looks right at that 10 second mark, but that's not the application I needed a remote for.So take all this for what you want, some people might be fine with the amazon version.  I'll sell you mine for $5 if you want to try it.  For me this was a lesson learned.

A small gripe--in this price range I would have expected a usb wall charger, but this is a small issue. The case is deluxe, as these things go.  The stiff, vinyl pouch offers good protection, it is zippered all the way around, and even has a small velcro strap to secure the USB cable.The speaker itself is 7.9 x 5.3 x0.7 inches and weighs only 12 ounces.  This is a beautifully designed and finished piece.  The  speaker grille is brushed aluminum with the Belkin-man logo in the upper left corner.  The brushed aluminum covers the top where the buttons are located.  The aluminum front is framed with hard black plastic, which raps around the side, the bottom, and the back.  The handle is connected to the upper sides and can swing around the back.  It doubles as the speaker stand.The USB port is hidden on the left side of the unit on the handle hinge.  When you swing the handle back you will find the Aux in port and the button for Bluetooth pairing.  All other buttons are found on the top of the device.  The volume +/- buttons are on the right.  In center you have the play/pause button flanked by right/left buttons to navigate through songs.  Then there is a call answer button and on the far left the on/off switch.  There is an LED that indicates charging and low battery status.  There is also a small microphone to the far right for answering cell phone calls.The device powers on easily.  Pairing was quick, easy, and does not require any code.  You simply tap the Bluetooth button on the side and wait until the speaker shows up on your device of choice.For a device of this size, the sound is incredible.  It excels pretty much at any type of music I threw at it from bubblegum pop, to Jazz, to classic rock, to heavy metal, and to classical.  The sound is clear.  The bass is incredibly rich and much better than expected, given the size of the device.  As to the bass, there is never any buzzing or fraying.The sound is well balanced.  Quite wisely, I think, the sound designers didn't over drive the bass, as is quite common on audio equipment.This, of course, is often a bit of a dilemma.  Bluetooth speakers almost never come with an equalizing function (and this one is no exception).  Some people really want a bass boost.  However, if you are playing anything other than pop or rap, overdriving the bass can be very distracting.  I prefer to have a less in-your-face bass, but this is something that people have to decide for themselves.  Please note that there is plenty of rich bass here, it just isn't designed to predominate.The treble is clear and never tinny and does not overwhelm as it can in many tiny speakers.This speaker is a stereo speaker.  However, as you can imagine, anything this small is going to have issues with stereo separation.  You will get more than a hint of stereo here, but it can't give you the same depth as two speakers that can be separated.Cell phone functions all work as advertised.  The auxiliary port delivers the same sound as Bluetooth.For a lightweight and portable speaker, you will get a much higher quality sound than you would expect from such a small package.

After a crash course in IP addresses, MAC's, SSID's, routers, WPS, and a lot of cursing and head slapping, I think I have my five camera home security system up and running.Initially bought three of the DCS-931L's, then accidentally bought two of the older DCS-930L's. They are for all intents and purposes the same in functionality, though I initially found the 931L's software easier to use. Stick with 931's.At first I had pretty good luck setting these cameras up with my old Buffalo Tech router. You hard wire them first, run the setup wizard (which you have to download as a zip file and is not real easy to get going), then you can WPS the cameras wirelessly. Move them and install anyplace. Range is surprisingly good.The MyDlink was ok to work with. This is the online portal to your cameras. The smartphone app counterpart was pretty good at sending me notifications of movement--at first. Then, suddenly, I started losing feeds from the cameras.  Pretty soon every one was dead. Must have uninstalled and reinstalled them a dozen times. And then I lost home WIFI. So, I assumed it was a bad router.  What luck.  So, I ordered a D-Link 855 model, more than anything because of \"zero configuration\" with their cameras.Installed the new router and everything seemed fine.  Then the same thing started happening. I could wirelessly configure the cameras straight from the router, but the IP addresses of the cameras were being assigned to other devices, and this caused all sorts of problems.  I kept uninstalling and reinstalling, trying to reserve IP addresses in the router...  Then I'd get them working only to find them slowly dropping out again. It seems to help to reserve the IP addresses of your other devices first, then install the cameras.I finally came to the conclusion that the way to install them is first to wirelessly WPS them from the router to the camera. Then I'd go into D-ViewCam (this is their proprietary PC program you use to record motion to your drive as evidence of trespass or burglary). In D-ViewCam I would manually \"insert\" the camera in the settings area using the IP address assigned by the router. Then I'd hop over to MyDlink and find the camera via \"zero config\" and set it up there online. That seemed to eliminate lost feeds, and for several days it has run with no problem. Most of the time the software couldn't \"find\" the camera during a scan, so I opted to key them in manually. It's easy. On a few of the cameras they still would not \"connect\". But if I walked away for a few hours, bingo!  It was as if it just took some time for the software to recognize them. One other thing, you need D-ViewCam to change the camera resolutions. I could not do this in MyDlink.There are a few quirks still.  MyDlink app has stopped giving me motion alerts. I can define areas of the feed to detect motion in D-ViewCam, but no longer in MyDlink web. It just shows a black screen. It will let you define a zone, but since you can't see what the image is it is of little use. I think this is why I'm not getting alerts via the app.  I don't know what happened and am looking into this. But the D-ViewCam does record motion to my hard drive. By the way, I am using a USB external drive hidden in the basement in case someone steals my computer!Anyway, to sum up, the cameras do work.  Picture quality is good enough to make out faces and cars coming up the drive.  I can keep an eye on the dogs quite easily using the smartphone app, though the latter does require a good strong fast connection. Otherwise, it just times out. I really like the D-Link routers.  Coming from years of the Buffalo Tech, they are much easier to configure with their outstanding web based portal. Five stars there. And setting up the cameras is nice because you don't have to use the MyDlink software, which I found buggy and hard to install, or a LAN cable.I have two cameras inside, three outside under the eaves, and one out in my carport. I have the repeaters on the 931's active, but even when they are off the range to other cameras straight from the router is good (about three walls, one brick, and 70 feet total). I plan on adding more cameras, including the IR versions for dark areas. So far the cameras have held up outside in below freezing temps and high humidity. They stand out like a sore thumb, but I figure if they get stolen it's too late. The video has already been captured. Because of this and their relative low cost, I have not taken measures to hide them. Hell, I want the thieves to put their faces in them so I get a close view!It has been a frustrating two weeks messing with these buggers.

I did need to find a magnetized screw drive because of the small screws but it was pretty much plug and play.There is room for a 3 1/2 device with i will add an all in one, and a smaller port someone mentioned in a review they found an ir receiver but I wished they'd added a link for it so I could make use of it.All in All I'm Very Happy and would recommend to a friend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fit like a Glove", "unixReviewTime": 1388966400, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2014"}

You're not going to set one of these on the floor next to your B&W; 801s, turn it on and walk away, and not be able to tell the difference between the two.  It's about as loud as you could expect a product with this size box to be, and it's actually pretty easy to bottom out the low end at high volumes.  But these are laws of physics.The product is simply outstanding as a tool to listen to music at a desk, at low to medium volume, when it is in front of you and pointing right at you.  In this situation the stereo imaging is spectacular and the depth of field really does sound like it's coming from somewhere other than this little speaker - especially with the &#34;LiveAudio&#34; feature activated, which has to be the only onboard &#34;surround simulation&#34; EQ I've ever tried and actually left on.The Jawbone's convenience can't be denied.  You can carry it around the house, pair it with anything, toss it in a small suitcase before a weekend in the mountains or a business trip, any of that.  That's not really a differentiator from any other small bluetooth speaker, but it's no less true.The speaker's high end is pretty directional.  You lose a lot of it very fast if you move away from a direct line of fire from the speaker.On the whole, this product plus an iPhone is about 50 times better than the &#34;jamboxes&#34; I carried around in the 80s, that had to weigh 30 pounds if they were to sound any good.

Unfortunately, they don't like the ones provided by Apple, as they are a cheaply made plastic, but they like the style of earphones directly in your ears. Fortunately, Brainwavz has made the Brainwavz M2 In-Ear Headphones as a mid price ranged earphones that have a good sound without absolutely breaking the bank.Package Contents:* M2 Earphones* Hard Carrying Case* 1 Set Comply Foam Tips S-Series* 6 Sets Silicone Ear Tips (S, M, L)* 1 Set Silicone Bi-Flange Tips* 1 shirt Clip* Instruction Manual & Warranty Card (12 months warranty)Accessories:As other Brainwavz products, these earphones get several accessories that many other earphone brands wouldn't get. The contents come in a very well made hard carrying case, with two pockets, that will protect the earphones and accessories, as long as the damage isn't intentional, such as running your vehicle over it. The silicone tips have a blue, green, peach, or black interior and black silicon exterior. I like that this includes several different colored and sized eartips that will work well with any ear size. This also includes one medium set of Bi-flange tips, that get optiminal in-ear sound, and foam eartips that tend to become damaged when removing them. This also includes a shirt clip that connects to the earphones past the Y connector. I love that Brainwavz includes every accessory that you would typically need for a standard set of earphones.Specifications:Drivers: Dynamic, 10.7mmRatd Impedance: 20 OhmsFrequency Range: 20 Hz ~ 20 kHzSensitivity: 115 dB at 1 mWRated Input Power: 10 mWCable: 1.3 m Y-cord; Silver-platedPlug: 3.5mm, gold-platedHardware:The entire length of the earphone wire is 50 inches long. At the base is a gold plated connector that is enclosed by a hard plastic at a 125 degree angle. I would normally name this a con, as this is a common feature from Brainwavz products that I dislike, but the casing seems durable enough to withstand some accidental tugging from my kids. From the connector, the wire, a unique rope-like texture, is 35 inches to the Y connector. I really like the texture of the wire, as it seems extremely durable compared to standard headphone wires, despite being so thin.  The wire from the hard plastic enclosed Y connector, a little thinner gauged wire, is approximately 14 inches. The earphones, themselves, have a metal-like casing, with eartips that go straight out. I am a big fan of earphones that go directly into the ear, as setup is simple compared to over-the-ear headphones, and the earphones almost are never heavy and bulky.Testing:I tested these earphones for approximately 8-10 hours on and off. During my tests I felt no irritation or discomfort. The silicon tips are very comfortable, as if I wasn't wearing any earphones at all. I heard different genres of music, including but not limited to: Rock, Classic Rock, Alternative, Pop, Rap, Classical, and Country. The sound is very clear without any distortion, and the bass is definitely good for low, mid, and high, but not the greatest. I find that theBrainwavz S1 In Ear HeadphonesandBrainwavz R3 Dual Dynamic Driver Earphoneshave an overall better quality bass, but those headphones are much more expensive, bulky, and are over-the-ear styled, which is very uncomfortable in my opinion. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product. I would definitely purchase this for my kids as a present.Final Thoughts:These headphones are probably geared best toward either young audiophiles, which tend to be more rough with electronics, and aren't difficult to replace, or audiophiles on a budget without breaking the bank. I would definitely recommend this product and is why I give this a rating of 5 out of 5 stars. The sound and bass are good enough to listen to good music and have a good time.Pros:+ Price is ideal without completely breaking the bank. Great present for kids.+ Very clear sound without any distortions; Good bass, but not great. (See cons)+ A direct to ear styled earphones with a unique rope textured (and durable) wire.+ Several accessories included; Headphone case and several ear tips+ A 50 inch cord that stretches nicely from my desktop.Cons:- Although the bass is good, Brainwavz S1 and R3 headphones have significantly better sound and bass, but are more expensive, bulky, and around-the-ear styled.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A budget friendly set of earphones that is a great present for kids!

I am a big fan of earphones that go directly into the ear, as setup is simple compared to over-the-ear headphones, and the earphones almost are never heavy and bulky. These headphones are very similar to the M2 and M3 headphones in terms of size, length, and construction, but differ in the casing of the earphones. You will get better acoustics with aluminum or metal casing, than a plastic one.&#9654; TestingI tested these headphones for approximately 3 days, or 7 hours of complete listening time, with both my Nexus 7 and my Windows 7 x64 custom built CyberPower PC. I used different genres to properly gauge the quality of the earphones including: rap, country, pop, rock, classic and rock. If you are used to the Brainwavz M2 or M3 earphones, you will notice the significant difference in quality, as their aluminum housing provides better acoustics, though the overall sound quality and bass of the Brainwavz Alpha is still much better than your standard $20 earphones. If the sound quality doesn&#8217;t entice you to purchase the headphones, then the comfortable fit will. During my extended tests, I felt no irritation from the ear tips. I was overall satisfied with the fit, build, and acoustics of the device.&#9654; Final ThoughtsFor the quality, comfort, and included accessories, you aren&#8217;t going to find a better set of earphones. I not only recommend, but also find this the best option for the sub $20 mark, which makes this the perfect stocking stuffer, and is why I give this a 5 star rating. I honestly don&#8217;t understand how Brainwavz is making any profit for this device when the case, itself, is $10 separately; it includes several accessories and tips, and has a rope-like wire. You are getting a really good value when you are purchasing this device.Pros:+ Great value for included hard case ($10 when sold separately), silicon tips, and accessories. Great present for your kids.+ Very clear sound and OK bass without any dissertations. For $20, quality is superior to any other earphone at this price range.+ Direct to ear styled earphones with a unique rope textured (and durable) wire.Cons:- Foam tips may become damaged if you take them off.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great bass and sound quality.

More 'DSLR' than 'entry level'. Let me use my usual disclaimer, and admit that with so many good cameras around, it is more about what mix of traits or features you are looking for.On that note, the camera's trait mix is as follows. It is a DSLR with 12.2 resolution (megapixels). Probably the most important point for this class of cameras is the sensor size, which is APS-C. That's just one step below 35mm Full frame.It has an optical viewfinder, which works through a pentaprism. That is the classical SLR construction. You are using the properties of light to view the subject before and during the shot. The purists would argue this is the way it was supposed to be- that is, with minimal electronic intervention. The ISO rating is 6,400 which makes it work better in low light. This rating is below many other DSLRs, but you would hardly ever need a higher ISO. Really. The video is a HD- that is 1080x720 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control the exposure  manually. It does have an external flash option. You would need that for portraits, at least. The LCD screen is a slightly smaller 2.7 inch with 230,000 resolution. The sustainable burst rate- for fast action- is 3 frames per second. The camera also does RAW processing which is useful if you did not want to be limited by JPEG storage only. The camera body weighs 495 grams, which is light compared to DSLRs.The T3 lacks a self-cleaning sensor unit for dust. For all interchangeable lens cameras, dust removal has become an issue, because you only need a speck to spoil the picture. And unless you remove it, it tends to stay inside.A nice camera, but somewhat dated when it comes to some traits.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice camera.

You even have some keys that aren't normally in Android, but can still be used, such as the CTRL and ALT keys.  I use it to take notes in my Mobisle Notes program, and even to play my C64 emulator.  The reaction time on it is pretty good and actually makes emulators usable, more so than just relying on the touch-based screen controllers.As for the feel, it feels much like the bluetooth iMac keyboard.  In fact, it will work with a Mac or PC, so long as it's bluetooth compatible, except the keys don't include the Windows or Mac special keys.It has those nice smooth chicklet type keys.  The keyboard is almost precisely the same size as my iMac wireless keyboard, and almost the same layout, too.  The keys are smooth to the touch, with just enough texture to feel satisfying and substantial when you type.  Just the right amount of resistance.When I use mine, I occasionally am playing music with a worship group, and when I'm done playing, I'll just tip my music stand back a little, and put my keyboard up on the bottom of the stand, propping my cell phone up on top of it.  Works great, and is almost as good for such purposes as would be a laptop.

I have an aftermarket antenna (Diamond SRH77CA) to help get a little more distance and clarity from some of the further out repeaters.  The radio looks small in the pictures and it is a bit of a small radio compared to my other radio.  It is almost wallet sized.  I found that after reading the manual while toying with it at the same time helps to learn this radio quicker.  I do not use the short cuts since there are so many for what this radio can do.  It is not too bad to use after that and is quite easy to use.  The stock battery that comes with the radio is only good for about 5 hours of use like the others have said.  I have the 1800mAh and it extends the operations time significantly.  The programming software will not work on Mac computers.  I recommend buying the MH-74 remote speaker/mic since that speaker is quite a bit louder than the one in the radio and the belt clips on the batteries are fixed and do not release your belt very easy.  If you use APRS like I do sometimes, you will only need the adapters on the radio if you do not plan to use the MH-74 remote speaker/mic.

About 2 minutes after starting the game the machine would shut down.Then I started to consider the possibility that it was the power supply. So I decided to hook up my multi meter between the computer and the wall socket and measure the amperage the power supply was drawing when it shuts down. I watched the multimeter closely and as the game starts to have more complicated stuff on screen, the amperage draw goes up (My outlet puts out around 120VAC), and at 3.7A the machine would shut itself down, which is about 440W draw. So I went to local computer parts retailer and bought a new power supply to replace this one (This time a name brand and a more heft wattage), did the same experiment with the new supply, and the machine would not shut down.This power supply does not live up to the specs advertised. Although I was happy with the number of connectors and the variety of types it had, I was completely dissatisfied with the power supply. I gave it an additional star because size-wise it's fairly compact compared to some other &#34;550W&#34; supplies I've used in other machines, and because of the variety of connectors. Other than that I can't recommend it to anyone.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Definitely not 550W", "unixReviewTime": 1393804800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2014"}

The mids and highs aren't exactly super, but they're clear enough to not warrant any undue focus or attention to them. These sound better than Beats Solo HD which I bought for my sister.Fit: This is where these headphones fall flat. There is a extremely odd shaped fit on the ear cups that seems slightly too small to be comfortable. I'm a pretty average sized man, 5'9&#34; 150lb, but these feel like they were made for teenagers (which they probably are). Kind of on that note, I had mentioned I wanted to use these for beaters, but quickly found that not only the physical fit didn't work, the personality fit didn't either.

Aside from that, these have a hardy plastic body that glistens very attractively, but also attracts fingerprints like glass. The color scheme is nice, but pretty loud branding; this is probably what pushed it over the fence as far as juvenille for me. The way these headphones fold is using these puzzle fit latches; you have to literally break the mated sections from each other in order to fold. This is nerve wracking every time as it always feels like you're going to break the headphones.The fact that these physically and mentally didn't fit me, I have just had them sitting on my shelf brand new never used.

It costs much less than the Garmin nuvi 350 that cost  me $278 six years ago.  The LCD display is much better, high resolution and helpful at showing the correct path at complex interchanges. And it  includes free map updates.But the navigation is noticeably inferior to the Garmin nuvi 350, or the TomTom XXL 540TM that I  bought 4 years  ago.The way I judge efficiency of a  GPS is by asking it to navigate local roads that I know  very well, to see whether it comes up with the most efficient route.  This GPS does poorly  with this.  For example, when I asked it to take me from my home to a destination seven miles away,  and I started taking some back roads, it kept telling me to revert to my original route, even  though this would have been substantially slower.  In other words, if you deviate from the original route, it just tells you to go back to that route, rather than recalculating and finding the most efficient route from your current position.Another way of judging a navigator is how well it predicts travel time. In this respect this GPS  is seriously deficient.  For example, on a recent journey late at night with very light traffic  and no obstructions, it started out predicting 19 minutes and ultimately the journey took 26  minutes, even though I was exceeding the speed limit most of the time and there were no holdups.  This is what it usually does.  My 6 year old GPS, on the other hand, is usually within a minute or  two for short trips, and within 3 or 4 minutes for longer journeys in excess of 50 miles.  If you are like me, and phone  ahead if I am going to be late for an important appointment, this is a real defect.So, I am giving this product 3 stars, because it is significantly worse at navigating than older  navigators that I own, even though it will get you there eventually.I bought this product  because my nuvi 350 maps are increasingly out of date. But I am returning this product and looking  for a GPS that is good at recalculating efficiently if I take a wrong turn or deliberately deviate from the initially chosen route.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Improved display, worse navigation", "unixReviewTime": 1399161600, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2014"}

They, instead, have tried to make this something that both competes with the Roku 3 for online streaming video services.  In the process, they've neglected and done a lamer job with the network share support for personal home entertainment users that have networked storage from to stream their personal video collection.  It even falls short of the previous WD TV Live Hub.  With the WD TV Live Hub, I can select \"Windows Shares\" and it finds my two WD Live Duo Cloud Storage devices on the network and allows me to add them to \"My Media Library\" as well as the shared USB drives attached to each of these networked WD cloud storage devices.  With this WD TV Live Streaming Media Player -- even after installing the latest firmware 2.01.86 -- when I select \"Windows Shares\" it just clocked endlessly and never finds them, even when I made sure the workgroup name was the same for all devices.  Ironically, out of desperation, I selected the \"Mac Shares\" option. To my amazement they were detected with that option.  However, with the \"Mac Shares\" option, it only detected the shares directly on the two WD networked storage devices and failed to detect the shared USB drives attached to the network storage devices (huh?)!  I experimented and tried all kinds of different things (and I'm not a novice at troubleshooting this kind of \"geeky\" stuff).  Just in case some \"bug\" may have been introduced into the newest firmware, I even tried rolling back the firmware to the version it came with (the \"Mac Shares\" option that only got me part way there did not show up on that version 1.16.13).  Unfortunately, that did not work either.  If I keep jumping between my \"Local Storage\" (USB drives attached to the WD TV HD media player) and \"Media Server\" option under \"Videos>Content Source\" it finds them that way, but I do not like to keep jumping back and forth between those options and prefer permanently adding them to \"My Media Library\" under \"Settings>System>Media Library>Media Library Manager for Network Share\" and then using the \"Add network share to media library\" option to permanently add them to my video content list under \"Videos\" so they are there whenever I boot up -- no fuss, no muss.  I follow this exact procedure on my WD TV Live Hub and it works flawlessly (all on the same network as I place this device on, mind you, but not on this WD TV Live Streaming Media Player.The irony in this whole scenario is that this \"WD\" branded device could not find the other \"WD\" branded network storage devices.  Don't they even test this with their own product?  Apparently not.  Strangely enough the user manual states:  \"Windows Shares display shared computers and network attached storage devices(such as WD's My Book Live personal cloud storage NAS drive) connected to your network via the Samba protocol.\"  -- Oh, really?  Maybe they forgot the part that you have to rub your belly and pat your head while selecting the \"Windows Shares\" option?After endless frustration, I concluded that this device does not properly live up to what it claims to do, which is to support networked storage, even when it is the WD brand!  As a result, I returned it to Amazon and instead am jumping off the \"WD ship\" when it comes to a media player for personal home entertainment and have decided to purchase the \"KDLINKS HD720 Extreme FULL HD 1080P 3D Media Player with Internal HDD Bay, Gigabit Network, Built-In Wifi.\"  That product has rave reviews and appears to be far superior for this type of media application than the latest WD device.  With this new WD TV Live Streaming Media Player, WD has not only fallen short on network share support personal home entertainment (while maintaining support for the attached USB drives), but they also fall short on the online streaming video services.  I own a Roku 3 and it is far superior for online streaming video services than anything WD has come up with.  I would even go further by stating that it falls short of their previous WD TV Live Hub as far as support for networked (NAS) devices.  Having both devices at my fingertips, I can confirm that what works on one (WD TV Live Hub) doesn't work on the other (WD TV Live Streaming Media Player), noting that the menu options for doing what I attempted is exactly the same on both the former (WD TV Live Hub) and this newer WD media player device.To me it seems like WD is trying to make this \"all things\" to \"all people\" when it comes to streaming video and has fallen short of competition all the way around.  If WD wants to \"carve\" out their place in this market and make it with their media players, they need to get back to \"basics\" and focus on what used to be the strength of their media players (playing personal attached and network storage of home entertainment).  They need to do a better job of debugging their firmware and curtail the addition of so many \"bells and whistles\" while neglecting the proper functionality of already existing (and essential) features.If my experience is good with my new KDLINKS HD720 Extreme FULL HD 1080P 3D Media Player, then WD has just lost this media player customer for good.  Maybe WD will wake up before it's too late and get back on track with addressing the interests and concerns of the niche market that purchased their media players to begin with.  As for this former customer, for now anyway, \"good-bye WD!\"", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Western Digital has lost its focus with this device", "unixReviewTime": 1395100800, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2014"}

The thought of spending $400-1000 for an amp to power $60 speakers just wasn't sitting well with me. Pretty much all the online forums pointed to looking for something used. The problem, is that where I live, I didn't know of any second hand electronics places, and I didn't relish the thought of spending weekends scouring the yard sales to try and strike gold. But as I read more and more (and more) online forums, I started reading about Topping amps. There are other brands at this (or even lower) price level, but Topping would even creep into sites and article aimed at the &#34;audiophile&#34; crowd, as the caviar taste on bologna budget. And Topping was even specifically mentioned along these speakers as a good combo on several audio forums. And I am so glad I went with this combo. Fantastic sound for $160 coming from my computer. I play iTunes, and even bought a few titles in FLAC, and play those using Foobar player (free download).I originally selected Topping TP20 for only $70, but the TP22 was just $30 more, and had quite a bit more power. I can say that the TP20 was rated (and reviewed) to be more than enough power, but I wanted to get the 30W per channel version to test out my other bookshelf speakers (Aperion) that I bought years ago. These are more power-hungry and I wanted to make sure I had just that little extra.The sound from this amp and the BS21 speakers is warm, which is fine with me.

Inexpensive means different things to different folks. In the audiophile community inexpensive means less than a thousand dollars a pair. These are on the high side of budget pricing. The recent $369 pricing on the Studio 530 made these a screaming bargain and I bought a pair here without ever hearing them. That is always scary as everyone hears things a little differently. It helps that the speakers have consumer great reviews there are not that many pro reviews. The American pro reviews are noticeably absent. Then British site WhatHiFi gave it 5 stars and described the speaker as great fun.  I have to agree.Horn loaded speaker such as inexpensive Klipsch speakers are often harsh and fatiguing. These speakers are very smooth with great detail, superbly tight bass and present very balanced overall. The horn tweeters on the Studio 5 series are marvels. Although there is a rising high frequency with these speakers it is very well managed with slight toe-in.These are exciting speakers to play and they really suck you in. I have Usher, PSB and NHT here and I like these a lot. Sound quality compares well with the NHT Classic 3 overall which were once called the best speakers under a thousand dollars. At the price difference I strongly favor the JBLs and the very tight bass helps make these speakers way more exciting and fun than the NHT.The 530 just has better base than the NHT. Just plain amazing bass for a 5 and 1/4 woofer. You can run them without a subwoofer and not miss it. If you do use a sub I suggest a good one. They will make cheaper subs sound bad. I think the NHT Classic 3 is a smoother speaker overall but not as open and seems carved out of a single piece of stone. The cabinet on the 530 is solid but other than looks is not remarkable in any way.  More importantly than looks or heft this is a very musical speaker. Voice, strings, percussion and piano are all very realistically rendered and the speakers have a big dynamic sound, These are very revealing and you will hear flaws in your recordings but you will be playing everything in your library just to hear these speakers sing.The cabinets are pretty strange looking but hey, form follows function. If these go one sale again just buy them. They are crazy good at under $400. If you need speakers now, they are worth every penny of the retail price. I never thought I would own horn loaded speaker but JBL's trickle down technology from their high end speakers really paid dividends on this one. JBL has not been a star in home audio over the last decade or so and have largely been ignored by the audiophile and enthusiast community.

Keep in mind, I'm no internet tech, and my experience is based solely on how the Zoom 5341J performed compared to the Motorola SB6121 and SB6141, *with my specific service provider (Comcast), in my area, and in my home*. All of these factors can have a significant effect on your own experience. Here is a rundown on my experience with each of the aforesaid mentioned devices. If you only want my comments on the Zoom 5341J just scroll down to it.All devices were used  in conjunction with Comcast Performance Blast service with 50 mbps download, and 10 mbps upload bandwidth speed. I measured the speed using speedtest.net. Each of the test results were reported to me using a server based in my city, so all of the results are best case scenario.Motorola SB6121To this day, I am still convinced I either bought a defective device, or Comcast did not recognize this device from the jump properly. From the moment I activated this modem, my bandwidth speed would jump from 58 mbps down and spike wildly all the way down to about 2 mbps, the upload speed would never eclipse 3 mbps, and usually hovered around 0.9 mbps. I tried restoring the factory settings online. The only result was the modem updated to a newer firmware, but that did not solve any of the bandwidth speed issues. The pings were very high as well about 70-160 ms, which is way too high for a test using a server in my own city. I also deactivated and reactivated the modem multiple times in hopes that whatever the issue was would resolve itself. I would get the same results over and over. I also tried a slew of fixes that I researched online. Nothing worked and internet was basically unusable.Motorola SB6141This device worked much much better than its predecessor, it just didn't perform as well as I felt it should have. Hardwired to the modem the SB6141 would get me 58 mbps downstream / 14 mbps upstream, which was beautiful to behold. In my bedroom (where the device was set up) over wifi, I would get a steady 55 mbps downstream and 14 mpbs upstream. I was living the dream for a few days. About 2 or 3 days later the Netflix streaming out in my living room would start buffering, and this is something that never happened with my previous DOCSIS 2.0 modem (Motorola SB5101), so I started doing speedtests again HARDWIRED to the SB6141. This time, although I was still getting relatively good speeds, the mbps would jitter up and down. Sometimes one test would start at 58 mbps and end at 35 mpbs downstream. Others would start at 30 mpbs and go up and down and end at 45 mpbs. Like the internet was struggling to get through at a steady rate. Pings would range between 14-40 ms. Not the vision of consistency I envisioned. Again, I know these results can depend on a lot of things besides the modem, but I've come to the conclusion it was the modem based on how the Zoom has been performing. I did the same things I did to the SB6121 to try and remedy the SB6141. Sometimes the speeds would be great, sometimes they would be ok, and sometimes they would jitter, all within a few minutes of each other. I kept a hold of the SB6141 to see if the Zoom (which I actually purchased before this device) would suffer the same issues.Zoom5341JFrom the moment I activated, to right this minute as I write this review, this device has worked flawlessly. I actually bought this device after the SB6121 failed me, and because I did not trust the brand name Zoom as much as I did Motorola, and the device seemed to run a little warm, I went and got the SB6141 just to make sure I was getting a quality product. My experience with the SB6121 should have taught me Motorola wasn't going to work for me in my situation, but I wanted the certainty of the name. Through primetime internet using hours, over wifi, hardwired, using multiple internet devices simultaneously, this thing has been an absolute beast for me. It gets me 58 mbps downstream 14 upstream hardwired, over wifi in the same room it gets me 55 mpbs downstream 13 upstream, out in my living room over wifi it gets me 21-30 mbps down/ 11 mpbs up. Although the distance from my bedroom (where I set up my modem/wifi) to my living room is not very far (roughly 75 ft), there are 2 walls, an AC unit, a water heater, and a patio between them. I know a lot depends on the wifi router, but the 5341J has been making sweet sweet love with my Netgear N300 WNR2000v3 (which is very far from a great router nowadays). The most impressive thing thus far is that I haven't had to do any research to get it to act right, my internet speeds have been steady as a tank, and it has not disconnected one time throughout the period I've been using it (roughly 2 weeks). If Zoom keeps this up, I may have to start purchasing more devices from them.Sidenotes: The Zoom 5341J runs warmer than both of the Motorolas I purchased. I wouldn't call it hot, just warmer than other modems I've had. If anything happens with the modem, I will be back here to report it. Also, the LEDs on the 5341J are BRIGHT. They can light up a corner of a dark room. At night it serves as a nightlight to keep monsters away and if I have to get up and use the bathroom haha. Its not \"burn your retinas bright,\" its just \"3 x brighter than the SB6141/6121 bright.\" Its not a problem for me, just something maybe others would want to know about.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Better than Motorola SB6121 & SB6141 *In my experience*", "unixReviewTime": 1404000000, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2014"}

So far, my wife has been able to keep her hands on the new Mini without the grandkids hogging it.My wife likes the Mini because:It runs the same apps as the iPad 2 does.It is smaller and fits on the table beside her chair better than the iPad 2 did.It is lighter than the iPad 2.  This is important because the OtterBoxes add significant weight to the iPads.  (We would never have an iPad without a case because of the risk of the grandchildren dropping them.)It works very well for what she does: FaceBook, Pinterest, searching the Internet and simple games.I like that it runs iOS 7 and the cameras are better than on the iPad 2.Much has been said about the low resolution of the screen on the original iPad Mini.  That is not a problem for us with the way we use our iPads.  I suppose if you used it for viewing a lot of videos, that might matter.  But, that is what we use our TVs for.The iPads have been very appreciated by the members of this household.  The grandchildren do use the larger iPads for videos and have not complained about the low resolution of the screens.  We currently have an iPad (1st generation), iPad 2, iPad 4th generation and the iPad Mini.  What we like about the iPads are the wide variety of apps available (many free ones) and the fact that they actually work.Prior to getting into the world of iPads, we had 3 different Android tablets which had a variety of problems:The Android tablets:Did not use Google Play.  Two of them required downloads from a PC to install apps.One had a resistive screen, which was hard to use.Two frequently froze up.  One had a reset hole an ear ring pin could be placed in.  The other simply had to be left alone for the battery to run down.While people complain about the iPads not accepting SD cards, we had problems with our Android devices not allowing all of the apps to be installed on the SD cards.We are very happy with all of our iOS devices (including 3 iPhones and 3 iPod Touches) because they work as they should.UPDATE:I forgot to state that I also especially like the new Lightning connector the Mini and the iPhone 5 has.  It is much easier to connect to the device than the old 30 pin connector or a mini USB connector that so many devices use.  With the Lightning connector, either side can be placed up when connecting to the device.  The old 30 pin can be difficult to connect without actually looking at the connector and device.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "iPad Mini Rocks!", "unixReviewTime": 1388793600, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2014"}

It still works by the screen started to show vertical lines and noises.  Finally decide to spend $600 and get this SmartTV by Samsung.  I can say that I am extremely happy with the TV.  However, I am unable to give this 5 starts for a few reason.First are a few pros.  The TV is very easy to setup and it is quite heavy for its size.  The TV stand is strong and compact to hold its weight.  It comes with 3 HDMI ports, and a few USB ports.  There is a PC port and regular analog port.  I attached Xbox 1 to the TV and it worked flawlessly.  I tried to play Blue Ray movie on my XBox 1 and only HDMI 1 allows the move to play.The remote that came with the TV works fine but trying to navigate and type on the SmartTV is futile at best.  I suggest that you get a USB keyboard (about $35) and it works well with the TV.If you have a Samsung smartphone, you will enjoy the way the phone interact with the TV.  You can easily share photos and videos from your Samsung smartphone by beaming it to the TV.  My family love this feature.Now, on to the negatives.  On initial boot up, Samsung requires updates on the SmartHub.  That takes a while if you use wireless network.  Once all the updates are done everything works fine.  One of the thing I noticed about SmartTV is the internal memory is quite small.  You cannot install a lot of apps on the TV.Another negative is using the internet to watch web videos will work for the first 10 minutes until the internal memory is full and the internet app will shut down.  I also tried using the Vevo app.  The SmartTV can play the app videos for the first 20 minutes until the videos start to stutter.

My roommates and I have a fair number of video game consoles, plus a Blu Ray player and a Chromecast and a million other things, and we got tired of constantly switching devices back and forth on our HDTV's two HDMI inputs. I also tend to be a big fan of having good speakers for listening to music and watching movies, and our TV's speakers were killing me. I bought this receiver so we could plug all of our different stuff into one central hub, and so I could use some legitimate external speakers for all of our media consumption.First off: the setup was easy. As others have noted, this receiver doesn't come with a full paper manual in the box. It comes with a quick-start manual and a CD with the full manual on it. The full manual was also easy to find on the Onkyo support website. So, slightly inconvenient, though not exactly the end of the world. It connects to a TV via a single HDMI out port, and has 4 HDMI in ports for different devices. It also has a variety of Component and Composite video in and out ports, as well as analog audio, optical audio, and others. The full list is above somewhere. The speaker connections were well labeled and easy to set up. For me, getting the receiver ready consisted of plugging my various devices into the different inputs, plugging in my speakers, plugging in the receiver, and turning it on. Of course, you can spend a lot of time tweaking all of the different settings if you want, and there are plenty to choose from, but going from &#34;just arrived,&#34; to &#34;playing on the big screen&#34; really was a snap.The sound coming out of the receiver is great. I've got pretty good speakers hooked up to it, and I was pulling all my audio from good sources through HDMI, and the overall sound quality was awesome. There are a variety of different listening modes you can choose from depending on your setup and how many speaker channels you're using, so you can optimize the receiver to your surroundings. There are of course plenty of more sophisticated audio settings you can choose from in the device's menus if you're going for complete customization.It's easy to switch between different inputs and assign them to different sources. However, keep in mind that the receiver can only output the same type of video signal it receives. So if you have a device hooked up to the receiver via component cable, the receiver has to be hooked up to the TV with component cable. The same goes for composite and HDMI. So I actually have the receiver connected to my TV twice, with a set of component cables as well as an HDMI. Not quite ideal, but it works.My roommates and I have found that 4 HDMI inputs isn't quite enough for us, and we still have to do some cable switching when we want to use a different source device, but whether or not you experience that problem depends on how much you're planning on plugging into the receiver. Also, the thing really does tend to get pretty hot. I'm told this is normal for this model and for A/V receivers and general, but it can be a little surprising just how warm it gets. It probably won't ever be an issue, but I'm keeping an eye on it.Otherwise, the thing works great. It suits my needs just fine. If I was going to buy another one, however, I'd likely spend more money to get a receiver that has more HDMI inputs, that can do video conversion, and has some wireless capabilities for syncing with online services. But if you're looking for something basic and not too expensive, this one should probably do just fine.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works great, but you might consider spending more for a better device", "unixReviewTime": 1390089600, "reviewTime": "01 19, 2014"}

I could not connect.  After an hour or so of troubleshooting, I determined that the PPTP service was highly unstable and would crash after a simple port scan.  So I figured I'd return the router and get something else - probably more expensive.Then I figured I should check for a firmware update, and sure enough, the latest firmware update addresses the PPTP bug.  In the release notes, it says, \"Optimize the stability of the PPTP connection\".  I downloaded and applied the firmware update, and all seems good.The PPTP service now seems stable, and has survived several nmap port scans and a vulnerability scan with Nessus.Note:  This router does not come with PPTP client software, but it's very simple to setup a PPTP connection on Mac OS X (Mavericks) natively, so that's nice.  It's simply a matter of opening system prefs, network, and adding a VPN connection.  You can even have a VPN icon in the menu bar.Connecting securely to the office is now easy, though I have not done exhaustive testing.  For the price, I recommend this product.Edit 1/3/2013----After some basic performance testing, it appears that throughput via PPTP is limited to 1Mbps up and down, so this may not be suitable for large file transfers or other bandwidth intensive activities.  The router supports 16 connections via PPTP so I imagine that it reserves 1Mbps for each connection...or something like that.In my opinion, it's still a great router for the price, but I would not rely on it for anything mission critical or in business environments more than a couple of users.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Price and Easy Setup, But Some VPN Issues", "unixReviewTime": 1388534400, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2014"}

The thing has always been fine getting thrown in a bag and knocked around a bit.That said, there is one MAJOR flaw in the design.  The short USB3 cable can be unplugged from the drive, and it is very loose where it attaches to drive itself.  Because of the direction of the cables tension, it puts stress on this connection and causes it to get looser and looser over time.  After a few months I got to the point where now, any time I plug it in, a slight bump of the drive or the table it is resting on will cause it to wiggle loose enough to lose connection with the drive.  Of course, this is akin to unplugging the drive from your computer with out properly ejecting it first, and puts your data at risk every time it happens (which is often).In the end, you're left with a rugged drive that can take a beating, but can lose your data with the slightest bump or nudge to the surface it's resting on.

It fits in front of the face of the tablet, rather than around the outside edges. It took me a little experimentation to get it mounted properly, but once I did I was quite happy and it was a stable, snug fit.  I'll add some tips in this review in case it helps others who purchase this monitor sunhood for a Nexus 7 or similar-sized device.I used this sunhood in combination withKaysCase X-Shape TPU Back Case Cover for Google Nexus 7 inch Tablet Android 4.1 Jelly Bean (Black)and mount it to my TX controller with anAmazonBasics Universal Windshield and Dash Mount for Smartphones, GPS, and Tablets including iPhone and Samsung Galaxy. The tablet case, universal mounting bracket, and sunhood all fit and work together perfectly.To fit the sunhood to your Nexus 7 or similar monitor or tablet:1. Set the hood with the back edge of it on the table, so the hood faces up. The three sides of the hood should be standing on their edges with the large top piece away from you, and the two angled side pieces extending towards you. The two attached velcro strips should be laying flat on the table extending from the top section towards you.2.  Place the tablet on its back on top of the two velcro strips. Set the three edges of the sunhood on top of the edges of the monitor.3. Fold the left velcro strip over the bottom edge of the monitor and upwards across the bottom left corner of the monitor. Slip it between the face of the monitor and the left edge of the sunhood about halfway up the left edge of the monitor. The loose end of the velcro strip will now be extending out the left side of the sunhood. Wrap it up around the left back corner of the sunhood, folding it around the top left edge of the hood and attach it to the velcro tab on the top left side of the top of the hood. The left velcro strip should now come up from behind the bottom left edge of the monitor, across the bottom left face of the monitor and out the left side between the face of the monitor and the hood, then wrap around the outside back left corner of the hood and attach to the velcro tab on top of the hood.4. Repeat with the right hand velcro strip, bringing it under the bottom right edge of the monitor, out the right side between the glass face and the sunhood, wrap it around the outside right edge of the hood and around the corner to the top of the hood, and attach it to the right hand velcro tab on the hood top.5. Take the free velcro strip (the one that isn't attached to anything)  and put the soft side against the lower back of the monitor about 1/2\" from the bottom edge, and wrap each end around the sides of the sunhood and attach it to the velcro edges of the hood sides.The three sides of the sunhood should now be facing outwards from around the top and sides of the monitor. You can adjust the strips to get it snug. The strip across the back will keep the two sides from flopping around.I added a small velcro self-sticking tab to the lower back center of my monitor case, under the free velcro strap. That keeps the free strap attached to the back of the monitor so it doesn't get dropped, so all I have to do it bring the two ends of that strap around the sides of the sunhood to attach them to the monitor.Overall, I am quite happy with this sunhood for my Nexus 7 as an FPV monitor for my quadcopter.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great sunhood for my Nexus 7 tablet while flying a quadcopter!", "unixReviewTime": 1396051200, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2014"}

Note that in reality this isn't very loud.  It's okay for a small room or a personal radio project.  But as far as being a \"car amp\"... that's a bit of a stretch. This at best should be considered a \"hobbyist amp at a low price\".THE EXPERIMENT.  Knowing (at this time) almost nothing about electricity but not afraid to try something off the wall, I wondered, \"How would this work as a guitar amplifier?\".  The answer:  lousy.  Apparently a guitar, whether passive or powered pickup, simply doesn't kick out enough power to register any volume on this device.  A preamp would be required,which kind of eliminates the purpose of the project... to amplify a guitar signal.  What I did was hook up a small rechargeable 12v 7Ah \"scooter battery\" as the power source, attached a decent external speaker, used a 1/4\" to RCA adapter to plug in the guitar, and tested.  Tried it with 3 different guitars, ranging from passive to powered pickup.  Barely audible.  Experiment requires more information; at this time has met with failure. (Note: the small 12v battery powered it just fine.  That part at least I had figured out.  It is a bit heavy though. : )WHAT DID WORK: Instead of a guitar I hooked in my cell phone.  That worked great; the phone cranked out enough earphone power to source this amp quite well.THE FIX:  I connected both black leads together and both red leads together (output side) and sent it to a single speaker for a total of 8 watts of power.  That seemed to do a bit better.  The trick is if you use a speaker small enough to be in the 4 watt range, it doesn't have much voice.  If you use  larger speaker, you have to up the watts.MY OPINIONS OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF:  Running my cell phone through it, it did just what it was advertised to do.  The sound was very clear, had good, crisp results, and was pleasant to listen to.  I heard no distortion.  I really like the control setup on this:  large power button, huge volume button with base and treble to the sides.  A nice addition is a color-changing light ring surrounding the volume control.  Some may find it distracting (especially while driving) but I enjoy it.I find this to be a good value, especially for the money.  It didn't work for my intended (experimental) purpose but for its actual intended purpose, it seems to work fine.  (I'm not giving up on my experiment though.  Still gathering info...)NOTE:  This comes with a bare-end power connector, so all you have to do is connect it to a 12v line.  That is very convenient and a nice added extra with this item.  On the other hand, this unit is VERY low wattage (4 watts per channel). If one needs more power there are 15w and 20w similar items available on Amazon.  They cost double of course, but have the potential to produce considerably more volume through larger speakers.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good item-especially for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1388620800, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2014"}

I've also used it in hotel rooms, at the beach, on cruises, and outside for summer parties! Never had so much as a hiccup with it! Sounds is as loud as it needs to be (I'm not expecting room-filling, surround sound with a portable speaker), it's crisp, and distortion is basically nonexistent, even at high volume. That range is also quite good. The bass isn't going to room-shaking, but it holds its one for a compact portable speaker. The battery life is as-stated and then some. I typically can easily get over 7 hours out of one charge. Fully charging doesn't take very long either, though I've never actually timed how long it take. It's small enough to take anywhere, as it doesn't take up much room in a bag or suitcase. It's durable, as I've packed it in everything from a suitcase to a plastic bag and never had an issue. It's been in damp environments and to the beach numerous times, and still works flawlessly. If I had one complaint, it's the strength of the BT signal. Unobstructed, the signal can cover 30 feet or so before the signal starts getting spotty, fully dropping out at around 40 feet. Not bad, but not great either. It gets worse with obstructions though, as even going around the corner between rooms can create interference. The signal won't completely drop, but it will get spotty quickly. However, I never expected it to pick up a BT signal much further than that, so this is a very small issue to me.

The WNDR3700v2 has treated me well for a few years now. At some point during its use, I swapped to a 3rd party firmware, and it has been running smoothly and with strong connections since then. So, replacing it wasn't a requirement, but the swap was in hopes of getting better range and faster connectivity from a newer product.Right out of the box, the Netgear AC1750 shows off a sleek, modern look. While it's good-looking hardware, the concern I have is that the grooves and air holes in the case will collect a great deal of dust. Dusting is not my strong suit, and I keep my router out in the open, so this should be fun.Of course, the guts are what matter here, so I went to plug it all in. Everything is simple to setup and configure. It even recognized my USB drive quickly and without fuss.The process consisted of the following:-Jotted down some of the important settings from my old router that I wanted to carry over (SSID, static IPs, etc.).-Reset my old router to set everything back to factory settings. Since I had 3rd party firmware on there, I had to use TFTP to get it back to factory firmware and reset everything.-Unplugged the old router and plugged everything into the new one - 4 network devices, the internet &#34;in&#34; cable, and a USB device.-Set my wired laptop to a static IP of 192.168.1.2 (just to avoid any complications configuring the new router).-Opened my web browser and went to 192.168.1.1 (the router's address). I was presented with a congratulation screen which gave me the default login and SSID information. I clicked on the option to &#34;Take me to the Internet&#34;.-Went back and typed in 192.168.1.1 in the browser again, so I could finish configuration. This time the setup loaded. I logged in with the default username and password, and then started making changes.-In the Advanced section: 1) set the Wireless Setup to include my SSID and passphrase; 2) set the LAN Setup to limit the IP range to 100-187 (just to limit how many devices connect to my network) and set a few of the old static IP allocations.-Rebooted the router, and then changed the admin password. At that point, I was done on the router.-Changed my laptop back to auto-DHCP (instead of the static IP I set on it earlier), and everything was done.I plan to leave it with this firmware for now in hopes that it suffices without the need for 3rd party. 3rd party firmware has just been much more stable for me with past routers. So far, this router has held a stable connection.Range is greatly superior to the former router. I get strong signals through all 3 floors of my house and well beyond the boundaries of my yard.While I haven't run official speed tests, the speeds I witness browsing and sharing files are at least as good as the previous unit. Saying they are better would be speculating at this point though. Speed tests usually mean little to me anyway, as I only really care about what I see in real-world usage - transferring files from machines on the network, streaming data from network drives, gaming, etc.All of my devices are working great along with the router - without modification. It is handling multiple gaming systems, a multitude of streaming boxes, an assortment of laptops and desktops, smartphones, and network drives.I haven't found a need for the Genie app yet, as I make most of my changes via the browser, but it does seem like a nice addition for those that like to keep an eye on things and make changes while on the go.Overall, I am very pleased with this router, and I hope it will keep me happy for years to come.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Range for days", "unixReviewTime": 1401321600, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2014"}

My Mini has a 1TB Fusion drive so 2TB is more than enough space for Time Machine.Setup was a snap: plug in the wall wart and USB3 cable and it immediately mounts since it ships pre-formatted for Mac. To be on the safe side, I used Disk Utility to reformat the drive as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). I erased the WD utilities, i.e., bloatware, since they're not needed and often cause conflicts later. I opened Time Machine and selected the drive and I that's it. Auto backups on the hour!There is no power switch so Backup Plus isn't a good choice if you prefer to manually power on and off. But for auto Time Machine backups it's perfect. The included USB cable is short so you'll need an extension cable if you plan to keep it further than a couple feet away. The drive case is plastic fantastic but with a rubber-like finish, making for a sure grip if you're prone to moving your drives around. And, while I thought the silver stripe silly at first, it actually looks good and matches my Mini. The drive activity light is a tiny white LED similar to the LED on the Mac Mini, making it less intrusive than the all too common blazing blue LEDs. Finally, the Backup Plus runs cool and quiet so the only sign of disk activity is that wee LED.I've detected no compatibility problems and Time Machine backups under Mavericks 10.9 are fast and seamless. In between backups the drive spins down but quickly wakes when needed. All in all an able backup drive, easy setup and good deal.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Backup Plus 2TB Rocks!", "unixReviewTime": 1388707200, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2014"}

Although this particular drive gave me a little issue with being recognized at first but once I disconnected it and retried it worked with no issue.The second drive which for me was most important was one that worked very well as a music drive that is compatible for my Ford Sync.  I have a lot of music as I am a huge music and movie fan but realistically I didn't really need all this space.  However, it was cheaper to buy this 1 TB drive than to get a smaller USB drive or even go with a music player such as my venerable IPOD.  I first tried using this straight out of the box only to find that the Ford Sync doesn't recognize a NTFS formatted drive.  So after reformatting the drive to make it Fat 32, I then connected to my Sync and found that it recognized right away as a USB player.  One small issue is that I noticed not all my music was syncing properly, so I used the Sync my ITunes program to fix any issues with that and also made sure I had my older ITunes with DRM fixed so that these could also play.  So far so good as this drive is working as it should permanently attached to my Ford Sync in my car.

I imagine it would work with a PS4 too, but I don't have one to try it out.I have to commend Sony for making the drive so easy to replace. The biggest hassle was moving the stuff from one of my external HDDs so I could reformat it to FAT32. The backup of the PS3 took quite a while too; The data files were heavily compressed. The only problem I ran into was an error that said the backup operation could not be completed&#8212;it went away when I restarted the PS3 with the external drive already attached and powered as opposed to hooking it up when the PS3 was already running.The drive passed the Western Digital Lifeguard extended test. I started using the HGST drive tool, but it was quite bare-bones and didn't even have a &#8220;Time Remaining&#8221; on the test window, which bugged me, so I switched to the WD software. HGST is a division WDC now, but whether they would accept the results of the WD software test is anyone's guess. Something tells me they would give you a hard time about and make you re-run the scan using the HGST software. The warranty is 3 years. I have RMA-ed several WD drives without any problem. I don't know if HGST would be as easy despite being part of WD. Again, anyone's guess. Hopefully I don't need to find out.As far as performance, I'm not really sure. I didn't benchmark it when it was attached to my PC. All I can say is it doesn't seem any slower than the drive which came with the PS3, a Toshiba 320GB, I assume 5200RPM.All in all, I would recommend this drive if you need a bigger drive for your Playstation..

I've been using Xbox 360's (the 'slim' model) for several years (after briefly testing a Linksys DMA-2100; horrible), but started looking for a new solution because of the size, noise, power & heat that are part of the Xbox 360 bargain.  The Echo is literally 4&#34;x4&#34;, totally silent, runs basically at room temp and uses very little power.  The Echo also has some extra capabilities, like being able to boot directly to live TV which was important for my set up.First thing to know when reading the reviews -- many of the are pretty old and outdated.  For example, you'll see lots of complaints about the bright glowing Ceton logo on the face of the unit... well, you can turn it off.  Also, a lot of people complain about things that are more broadly related to WMC, like the lack of wifi... well, WMC extenerds doesn't function well on wifi (try it with an Xbox 360) and this is a Windows Media Extender, so what are you going to do?Xbox One & Ceton Echo; no problems.  One of my Echo's is connected to the TV via an Xbox One using the HDMI pass through.  It works perfect.  For this type of set up, you really need to boot directly to live TV to play nice with the Xbox One's TV capabilities, so the Xbox 360 extender solution fell short.  Keep in mind, if you do this and you're components are in a cabinet, you'll need to connect an IR out to the back of the Xbox one and connect the IR eye just to the left of the &#34;Ceton&#34; logo.  All of the voice command/channel change stuff work great.Pros- Small footprint.  Low power, heat, etc- Easy to set up.  I was up and going in about 5 minutes.  Probably about the same complexity as connecting a new wireless router.  I did have a set up issue with one of the unites, where it was cycling between &#34;Connecting&#34; and black screen.  I just removed the extender from my computer and re-ran the set-up.Cons- Price.  $180 is ridiculous for this devices capabilities.  I think $80 to $100 seems like the right range.  I was able to get 2 for about $220 during a promotion. It was a little high, but in the range.- Performance is ok.  If you turn off the transition animations, you should be fine.  If you've used the old Linksys DMA-2100 extenders, don't worry, it's not like that at all.  For reference, navigating the menus feels similar to a Roku 2.- The remote is garbage, can confirm.  Throw it away and buy any other Xbox 360 remote.  Even better, there are some really great Windows Media Center remotes floating around on the internet.  If you look hard, you might find a few.Overall, I would recommend if you can buy for around $100.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "It does it's job", "unixReviewTime": 1389916800, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2014"}

I bought this camera for $254 as it was discontinued and dealers wanted to eliminate stock.The main feature I was upgrading for was the 16mp sensor which is the same as used for the top of line Oly cameras now; I like to make posters.  The em-2 only has a navigation pad and no dials so everything is done from there or the touch screen and you need to enable the SCP for efficiency and with that feature you don't miss the dials too much at all; don't forget to setup the highest resolution too.  I was really pleased with the touch screen for focus location and snapping pictures or even picture setup which is very responsive.  The 8 frames/sec is also great for action like kids.  I found the two axis stablization the same as my epl1.  Low light performance compared to the epl1 is an order of magnitude better but I don't due much low light picture taking.The body is smaller than the epl1 and almost too small for some people.The main issue I had with the system was the kit lens which has nothing to do with the camera.  Because I was looking for better resolution I did not find it using these lens which means they cannot really fully utilize the 16mp sensor.  I have an adapter for my old Nikon Nikormatte film camera and mounted its 50mm prime lens and then used my kit lens at the same aperture priority and zoom.

As you can sense I'm an extreme shopper looking for maximum value for the dollar.I personally am returning it for this reason but for those who don't have 4/3 system you can get this camera with the two kit lens now for about $400 which is a really good deal.

This is optically the same lens that Tamron markets in Canon, Nikon, and Sony mounts. In other words, it is a Tamron lens in Pentax clothing.I think the best way to rate this lens is to look at the pros and cons.On the pro side, I would list convenience as the main reason to purchase this lens, because it does not have much else going for it. We all want a lens that will go from a relatively wide angle to a fairly long telephoto in a small compact package. This lens fits that niche in you camera bag. It is an all-in-one walk around lens which is good for travel photography. Here I am talking about snap shooting, not serious photography. The only other plus for this lens is it's build quality, which is very nice.Now to the cons. First this lens is way over priced. I would never pay the MSRP for this lens. Right now Adorama and B&H; are both listing it at close to $800.00. The Amazon price is lower, and depending upon the seller, can be much more or much less than that price. I paid about $300 less than the Adorama and B&H; price. Folks, this is not $800 glass. It is not what I would rate as very sharp at any focal length. Although it is fairly sharp at the short to mid focal lengths, is somewhat soft at the long end. Plus, it is slow. The f3.5 at the short end is not too bad, but f6.3 at 270mm is not very good. I found the AF had difficulty at the long end finding anything to focus on, so it just quit trying. Otherwise, the SDM focus was smooth, quiet, and fairly fast. There is a AF/MF switch on the lens, and a zoom lock for storage. There was no zoom creep on the considerable zoom extension, which was quite smooth.This lens is not weather resistant, something you would expect in a Pentax lens, especially at the suggested price. Nor does it have the Pentax Quick Shift focus system we have all come to expect in Pentax lenses.I bought this lens for the convenience of not having to carry more than one lens when traveling, and not having to change lenses when visiting crowded places. I think I will continue to carry at least two lenses, because the IQ is just not there with this lens. I would recommend that you consider purchasing the PENTAX DA 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AL Weather Resistant Lens @ $145 and the Pentax HD DA 55-300mm f/4-5.8 ED WR @ $411 instead of this lens. Yes, you would have to changes lenses occasionally, but both of these lenses are Weather Resistant and both have the Quick Shift focus. Plus they are both better glass than the DA 18-270mm.  Both of these lenses are also available in non weather resistant versions at considerable savings.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not a steller lens.", "unixReviewTime": 1389916800, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2014"}

That means no missing/shoved-over Shift key, no missing row of Fkeys, no teeny-weeny scrunched together letter keys (hello, Ebay cheapo tablet keyboards), no Command key where the Alt key should be (hello, Apple mini wireless keyboard and clones), and no Fn keys mapped by default to system-specific functions like brightness and volume (hello, Android and Apple clone keyboards).  This one seems to have it all.  The key spacing is awesome.  Plus backlighting, one of the Ultrabook/MacBook Air features I love.Now the real surprise bonus.  I can finally map CapsLock to Ctrl, and map it back to some other key.  Meaning, I still have CapsLock when I really want to shout at someone.  Somehow this has never been possible with the standard keyboard remapping software out there (which twiddles some registry settings).  But, with Logitech's SetPoint software (required to get the Fkeys to not map to things like media keys by default), you can also remap three of them (F4/task switcher, F11/Home, and F12/Calculator) to a variety of other functions, including a keypress of your choice.  Well, it turns out that if you map that to CapsLock, and then use a remapping program (I used SharpKeys) to remap CapsLock to Ctrl, you've still got your CapsLock (only now it's Fn+F4).  Done!  Awesome.By the way, their SetPoint software (which appears as an icon in the tool tray) also took over management of my Dell bluetooth mouse, and remapped the wheel button to \"Scroll\" (which I promptly un-mapped back to \"Middle click\"), but also let me remap the side buttons and wheel left/right.  So that was a second surprise bonus right there.  (Presumably it will do similar things with other mice, though I haven't tried it.)It also monitors both devices' battery condition, which I'm sure will be useful.  So this is one 78 MB download that seems to be worthwhile (unlike some -- hello, HP inkjet printer driver).So there you have it.  Highly recommended.  There's a Mac-specific version also  (presumably it has the usual Apple keys in the bottom left corner), the K811.  Maybe there'll be full-sized ones as well.  I'd buy those, too.Wishlist for the next version: Include real PgUp/PgDn keys so I wouldn't have to use two hands to navigate documents.  Have some kind of kickstand that folds out at the bottom rear so I don't have to lean it on a pen to get the right angle.  Make a full-sized (full-width) version including the keypad.  Include (or offer) a neoprene carrying case so I don't have another laptop one flopping around in my backpack.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Surprise bonuses for the very power user", "unixReviewTime": 1393027200, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2014"}

And then there's capacity and reliability to consider.ThisTOSHIBA PH2100U-1I54 1TB 5400 RPM 8MB Cache SATA 3.0Gb/s 2.5\" Internal Notebook Hard Drivehas respectable performance numbers, but it's no SSD screamer... and for the price, it's an excellent product. From past experience, there is not an astonishing performance difference between 5,400 RPM and 7,200 RPM hard drives. The SSDs will probably boot up and shut down faster depending on your equipment and configuration, but the cost difference to get a 1TB SSD is substantially higher.I personally looked initially at this Toshiba hard drive as a replacement for the original HDD in myApple MacBook Pro 13-Inch Laptop, effectively doubling its existing capacity. It's not a difficult process for those who have done it before and are already running the built-in OS X Time Machine backup utility. In any case the Apple forums offer plenty of how-to advice on this topic.For now this Toshiba hard drive is being used to back up my upgraded Windows 8.1 PC notebook, and it's almost effortless. Had earlier purchased aPlugable Storage System USB 3.0 2.5\" SATA Drive Dockalong with the extraPlugable Storage System 2.5\" SATA Hard Protective Case (2-Pack), and this combination makes it all quite simple. One mounted in the case, the Toshiba HDD was recognized immediately, and it was simple to set it up for backups in minutes.If you're looking for performance on the level that gaming enthusiasts desire, this is perhaps not the right drive for you. It has a respectable transfer rate of up to 3.0Gb/s, but with notebook SSHD (Solid State Hybrid Drive) products that offer rates up to 6.0Gb/s, this one may disappoint. Its strengths lie in low power consumption, adaptive (variable) power modes, internal shock detection and ramp loading technology (vibration reduction) to help protect your drive and your data. And these are just the right features to make this an excellent backup hard drive.Perhaps the best things about thisTOSHIBA PH2100U-1I54 1TB Internal Notebook Hard Driveare that it is fully compatible with Windows 8.x, Windows 7, Windows XP, Vista, Mac OS X and Linux, as confirmed by Toshiba.

One for use, the other in the shop being fixed.It's no exaggeration to say that when I handle my M240 it makes me better than Cartier-Bresson.  After all, that poor fellow used film, was clueless about Photoshop and had to manually set everything. He must have snapped a lot of images to luck out with the few grainy, blurred ones that sadly pass for art today.  I mean, that guy jumping the puddle?  Hello, motion blur.  Had he used an M240 he could have cranked up the ISO and shutter speed and bingo!, a sharp snap.  Why, he could have taken 9 in that one second and chosen the best.  Boy, would the old man have killed for the high speed motor drive in my M240s or what?  Goodness knows, he really needed it.As for the Leica 'glow' in the images, they are instantly distinguishable, though I find I get less glow after I clean my new $8,000 Asph Summicron with a pocket handkerchief to remove the residue from my Romeo y Julieta Cubans.  (I have a man who works for the embassy here &#8230;. embargoes are for the little people)  I accidentally spilled some Cristal on the front element the other day at the Greenwich estate but, with typical Leica reliability, it soldiers on, though the focus movement seems a bit sticky and I appear to have some deposits in the lens.  We Leica users call that &#8216;character&#8217;. And the glow improved, so I recommend this treatment to all Leica lens users.My Noctilux cannot seem to nail focus at f/1.0, which is a bit disappointing as I paid $20,000 for it on the black market to beat the queue, so I generally use it at f/5.6 or lower, but it's worth it for the rendering and depth of color alone.  And even when it&#8217;s out of focus, which is much of the time,  the Bokeh renders those defocused blobs like nothing on earth. In fact my first attempts at f/1.0 were all badly out of focus, but I kept them anyway, and fellow Leica users are all astonished at what the lens can do.  That&#8217;s the sort of 100% success rate only Leica can deliver.  And, let's face it, the Nocti and M240 scream success, once others see that huge front glass and the red dot.  This combo delivers a frisson no Canon or Nikon using poseur will ever experience.  Only a Leica says &#8216;photographer&#8217; in that special, indefinable way.And what makes this so much better than all those years with my M2, M3, M4, M6, M7 and MP (yup, all in my China cabinet, with the original boxes, under 6 rolls of film put through each) is that my $150,000 of Leica glass has never been happier, even if I do have to pull the battery now and then when the M240 freezes just as I press the button for another capture of a dozen Decisive Moments.  But the fact that I only missed a hundred or so great images in my first month of ownership is nothing compared to the thrill I get just holding the M240.  I can't wait for the gold plated special edition which should match my Rolex collection nicely.

Around a week ago, I purchased a Dell S2340M from Best Buy for around $170 (after taxes and an Amazon price match). I figured that it wouldn't hurt to share my opinion of it; perhaps somebody will find this post helpful.First, this is a well-made monitor. I considered getting the Acer H236HL bid because it was slightly cheaper, but I quickly changed my mind when I saw it side-by-side with the S2340M. The glossy stand looks professional and does a good job of keeping the monitor stationary; knocking the sides of the display causes minimal juddering, and the base does not move. The panel's glossy finish looks very nice, but you should take care to avoid setting the monitor up near bright lights. Also, the plastic bottom lip of the display does not look or feel cheap, unlike the lip on the H236HL. I find the S2340M's dim white power indicator to be much less distracting than the blue ones on most monitors; I think that the subtlety of it contributes to the monitor's attractive design as well.I have been very happy with the performance of the S2340M. I mostly use it for gaming and movies, with a bit of Photoshop periodically. With this being my first IPS panel, I was very impressed with the vividness of the colors. I love being able to lean back in my seat and not have any colors suddenly wash out. I made some changes with Windows 8.1's color calibration tool when I first hooked up the monitor, but the default configuration didn't look that bad. When it comes to gaming, the S2340M has a response time of 7ms, compared to my old monitor's 5ms time. I am not a hardcore/competitive gamer, so that is not a big issue for me. I did notice some ghosting while playing Titanfall, but only when I made a point of looking for it.This monitor does have its faults, but none of them are bad enough to make me regret my purchase. First, it only has VGA and DVI inputs. I only use DVI, so that's not an issue for me. It might be a problem if you connect multiple devices, since the VGA input will look noticeably worse than the DVI one. By the way, the monitor only comes with a VGA cable, so make sure you have your own DVI cable. Second, there are no VESA mounting holes, and the stand only allows for vertical tilting. I did a little bit of searching, and you can actually buy custom VESA adapters for this monitor on Ebay if you want to mount it. Speaking of the stand, I had a hard time inserting the monitor into it. Pushing it in 2/3 of the way was easy, but I needed to apply much more pressure to completely secure it. I was afraid of breaking something, but it eventually went in.If you're looking for an IPS monitor under $200, you should get the S2340M. Its impressive design and beautiful display make it a great deal. Although you might be able to find the Acer H236HL bid for slightly less, the superior build quality of the S2340M justifies spending the extra money. There are better dedicated gaming monitors in the same price range, but the S2340M's rich colors make for a better experience in more usage conditions.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great monitor at a great price.

Dual driver earphones are like 2 way speakers for your ears. They're better than the usual single driver earphones because 2 drivers can cover the audio range much better than 1.

The dual drivers aren't a gimmick and the woofer really does its job well. The 6.8mm driver covers the high to mid range pretty well. In music without much bass, I found the mid range to be best. Overall, I found the sound to be balanced more to the low end.Extras:As with most of the Brainwavz products, I found this set of earphones to be loaded with extras. I won't list them all here as they can be found on their website but they include loads of extra tips, airplane adapter, hard case and a 1/4\" audio adapter.Thoughts:Price wise, these dual driver earphones are at the low end of the spectrum and their performance far exceeded my expectations. They are not cheapo dual drivers, they really perform. And the design is full of little touches. The drivers are side by side and if you look into the grill you can see that the drivers' output is separated from each other by a divider for better frequency dispersion. Furthermore, the cable at the earpieces have a stiffer covering that will retain its shape so there is no need for ear hooks. It's these little touches which make this brand stand out for me.Summary:You can find dual driver earbuds at much higher prices, but these R1 earbuds at this price is an absolute steal.

Verizon did not do this, hence I lost HDMI functionality on a projector and a receiver during a thunderstorm).I was hoping to replace with something that gave me at least the same performance as what I had, and I was thrilled that this projector exceeded my old ViewSonic in each and every category.Even in Eco mode, this projector delivered a much brighter, clearer picture than what I had before.  Also, the throw distance on this projector is quite short, which is a huge advantage even if you have the space for a long throw (since you can get a larger projection size for a given throw distance, or reduce the zoom level for a given projection size and given throw distance).  For me, I was able to significantly reduce the zoom level to almost the minimum in order to keep my 150\" projection size.  As a result, i was able to get an incredibly sharp, and bright picture.My unit shipped with the 1.07 version firmware, and I have not found any handshaking or HDMI detection issues when used in conjunction with my Denon receiver.  I believe there is a 1.08 firmware version out now, but I will pass on attempting to update the firmware since all is working perfectly.  I have heard that units that are below the 1.06 version may experience HDMI detection issues, but it looks as if the new units are shipping with 1.07 or later, so you should be good to go right out of the box.I also ceiling mounted this projector with the same universal ceiling mount as I had my previous projector, and I think that most universal ceiling mounts should work just fine using M4 screws to attach to the projector.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Spectacular projector at ANY price", "unixReviewTime": 1404259200, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2014"}

I spent 3 weeks deciding between three brands but the reviews of the Fuji sold me. This is not a DSL with interchangeable lenses but the supplied lens is amazing.  It is a little hefty, which I actually like, due to it's aluminum internal case and big lens vs. plastic for all others I considered.  The 22 mm to 1000 mm zoom lens is phenomenal.  A quarter turn of the barrel goes from one extreme to the other.  The photos taken are top rate and this camera has so many features it will take me 6 months to try everything.  The instruction book is less than 10 pages with tiny print but you can download a 132 page manual that is actually pretty well written.  The camera can easily change from a point and shoot mode to a sophisticated bridge digital camera with a twist of the selection dial. The way the vibration/movement dampening works especially at 1000 mm is awesome and the burst modes go from 3 to 11 frames per second.  All pre-programmed menus which are detailed, extensive and all very good require 3 clicks or less to activate any mode.  If you manual set your shooting conditions you can save those setting for later use.  You can shoot normal, fine, or raw images.  Video record for up to 25 minutes and you can change zoom and take individual shots while recording with it's intelligent auto focus system.  The camera starts up very quickly and responds and auto-focuses quickly as well. If you want a point and shoot look elsewhere and save a few bucks but for a serious sophisticated camera that rivals DSL's a half the price you can't go wrong.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One amazing bridge (not DSL) camera", "unixReviewTime": 1398038400, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2014"}

I don't have steering wheel audio controls so I cannot comment on that aspect of installing or operating the unit.The unit has a surprising number of nice features and inputs/outputs, although navigating through the menus can take a bit of getting used to.Pros:The radio and disc player both work fine. Radio display when screen is open is particularly good looking.Seems to have plenty of undistorted audio power.No problems with the operation of the touch screen. A calibration routine is buried in one of the setup menu items.The physical screen can be closed during operation and has a feature to adjust the open angle slightly to minimize reflections (in bright sunlight this isn't going to help much at least in my car).Navigation works amazingly well, but as other reviewers have noted (1) it's very talkative with no option to curtail the excessive verbal warnings about upcoming maneuvers, and (2) it mutes the source completely when talking (Nav volume can be adjusted independently however).BT pairs with my Galaxy phone and will stream music as well as handle phone calls.Video input for backup camera works great with the cheap $20 camera I purchased. Installation recommendation, connect the 12 volt trigger to a switch, NOT the backup lamps. In my unit, the screen opens and retracts each time the car is placed in reverse. If you're a bad parallel parker like me, the screen will be going up and down several times each time you park. Quite a good show but also annoying.Haven't tried the separate output for video screen, seems like a nice feature to have.Cons:- As previously noted, the display is very hard to see in bright light. This applies to the LCD on the face of the unit as well as the screen. I you have a choice of installing in a high or low dash location, or if you have a double DIN opening and a choice of top or bottom, I would recommend the lowest available spot, otherwise you'll never see the screen during the day.- Limited user menu and screen customization with photos etc, as far as I can tell you must select wallpaper and backgrounds from those supplied by the manufacturer.- Mostly I've been pleased. I've subtracted a single star for the unit's inability to read more than the first 1Gb from the user micro SD card slot. Technically I believe the description is correct since the original SD spec was limited to 1Gb cards, and this unit makes no claim to read SDHC or SDXC size cards, but I still suspect that most users would expect at least SDHC capability in 2014. Ditto, I can only get the unit to read the first 1Gb from a 32Gb USB drive.- No user adjustable graphic equalizer, just bass/treble/sub and some presets.- Dubious future availability of firmware and map upgrades.

Yes, it's pricey compared to the competition, but it's worth every penny in my honest opinion.Pros:1) Easy setup - plug it in and it seeks the WiFi signal; a couple of clicks, enter WEP and you're connected.2) Remote - took a little while to figure things out, but once you do, it is extremely functional, very well thought out by SONY. The \"return\" button is exactly where you want it and it will back you up from one page/screen to the previous one perfectly.3) Streaming - streams movies from Amazon and Netflix without any buffering (pauses) at all, but obviously you must have a strong signal, if you don't, you can't blame the TV.4) Picture - this is the most amazing picture I've ever seen, I'm sure only a 4K could be better. To save time in the beginning I searched for settings that other people used, a few of them worked but most of them didn't. My picture settings are down-right PERFECT, maybe I'll post them for you to try at a later date.5) Speakers - they are probably the best you can get in a TV like this, but I'm using a Denon amplifier and Klipsch speakers (highly recommended for a theatre experience)6) 3D - the 3D rendering is astounding, but watching it has always been a chore for me. The glasses are comfortable and work well but sitting through a 2-hour movie is very hard on ones eyes. I believe this is why 3D never took off like the industry hoped it would. Some 3D movies are simply too intense to look at for a couple of hours and leave me with a splitting headache.7) 2D - this is why you will not miss the 3D, when you get a great movie or TV station, it looks like 3D without the eye-strain. 2D to 3D is an unnecessary feature IMHO because of the quality of the 2D picture.8) SmartTV - the SONY SEN smart hub displays all of the apps and scrolling through them is a breeze. \"Home\" page gives you the current input options as well as \"History\" of recent apps for quick selection and a \"Settings\" menu. There is also a built-in user manual which is ideal if you get stuck with anything. Also, the TV knows when I'm watching TV or streaming anything and will change the \"scene\" setting automatically. The TV remembers all of your picture settings so you don't have to change them when going from the internet to a Blu-Ray player, X-Box, or Cable-TV.9) Web-browser - compared to the competition I think it is excellent with the ability to have bookmarks right at your disposal10) Gaming - I do not play games but if the 3D is any indication, it must be awesome on this TV11) NetFlix/Hulu promotion - finally got it going, one year FREE for each, close to a $200 valueCons (all minor):1) does not work with generic mice and keyboards, so you must use the remote to type2) a little pricey, but I did not like some reviews of the Samsungs where the panel just died after a year or two. SONY's should last a lifetime.3) the NetFlix/Hulu promotion app did not work, but SONY tech-support came through with an activation code after 3 or 4 days4) as someone else pointed out, you cannot delete some of the apps on the SEN screenNo doubt about the 5-Stars, purchase this TV and you won't regret it for a minute.Thanks for your time.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Incredible TV!", "unixReviewTime": 1388880000, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2014"}

I have several hard drives and disk drives and ran out of SATA ports to use on my mother board (only has 6). Was looking for a adapter that would make use of my unused pci-e 2.0x1 slots on my board (or even the pci-e 2.0 x8 and x4 slot since I only run 1 video card these other ports just collect dust) but give me more SATA ports. This fit the bill perfectly and for much less than several other brands adapters on the market. Not only do you gain 4 SATA III(6gb/s) rather than most other adapters only give you 2 SATA ports and are not always SATA III. I followed instructions but if you are even slightly schooled on computers and computer parts you could just guess what to do fairly easily. Unhook everything, power cord disconnect and install the card in the pci-e 2.0x1 (or x4 x8 x16) or pci-e 1.0x1 (or x4 x8 x16). With the pci-e 1.0 it will just run at half the speed if you have an ancient board but is still compatible. Also I didn't seem to find anywhere in the description about the SATA cables so I ordered some.... It comes with 2 and they are both SATA III capable. I had no issue with the drivers, didn't even need the disc. windows 7 x64 recognized the device and downloaded them.FOR PEEPS WITH WORRIES ABOUT POSSIBLE COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS- This is my system setup and install and use went without any issues.

Which is also very straight forward using the menu from the provided remote. It is WiFi connected to our home network and through it to the internet, and this was perhaps the longer process for having to enter the WiFi data (SSID, security type and password) using the scroll button in the remote to work with the on screen keyboard. The configuration process is actually very friendly an intuitive, and uses graphics in the source and connecting ports configuration, that look very much like what you have on the back and side of the TV as connection ports, so it's difficult to make a wrong choice.During the setup process being connected to the internet, it detected a new firmware update and I let it perform the upgrade (it takes a little while, from 20 to 30 minutes). That went without incidents, and the configuration parameters didn't change in my case.By early afternoon we were already watching content from the internet (crackle, Netflix, and some other stuff available through the menu). We also watched an old DVD movie (1080p @ 60Hz) and the image was very crisp, we haven't yet bought any Blu-Ray movie (1080p @120Hz) so I'll update on that some other time. The analog signal coming trough the AVR from the DirecTV box is very good for a Standard Digital TV signal.So far, we are very happy with our purchase and If anything changes, I'll adjust my review. But for now I would definitively recommend this product to anyone with a small entertainment space (ours is 130 square feet)', that doesn't need a larger screen, but still want a great quality pictures from Satellite TV as well as BD and/or DVD.

This TV is in the same ballpark which is kind of sad given that 2014 seems to be the year the plasma TV is going to rest in peace.  If you are a gamer like me, I would seriously think about buying a plasma TV before they are gone because the display of the different shades of black (which can really help killing zombies) and the 600 Hz (critical for a fast moving game like Rayman) are really critical to a great picture when gaming and even OLED can't match the Hz rate for $5000+.

HardwareAs it stands it is the most powerful 8th gen console. It plays games from 720p - 1080p in 60FPS if you care about those. 500GB of space, but you only get 407 GB in reality. The rest goes toward the OS I guess. If you want to upgrade the HDD you can but I recommend waiting. A 4 TB 7200 RPM HDD will cost 200$ and so will a 256 GB SSD. More space is nice, but for half the price of the system? And SDD's load the game quicker but I'll wait for the price to be reduced.2. Software/OSMany times faster than the PS3's OS. Pretty simple as well. That's it.3. ControllerMajor improvement over the PS3's. Bigger, concave thumbsticks, trigger R2 and L2 buttons. Light bar and touchpad are borderline unless in my opinion, the light bar more than the touchpad (unless you have the PS camera). Thumbsticks might be cheaper than the PS3's. Mines already has a small scratch on the right stick on the top, but that might be my fault. I had the controller and the system in a small bag and yeah...4. GamesNot a ton of exclusives or even multi plats for that matter. May take a couple of months for lots of games to come on the system. I'm playing BF4 currently. Took a while to learn the controls from BF3 on the PS3, but I got it. Looking forward to Watch Dogs next. Deep Down maybe. Capcom is Capcom.5. AppsNot many either. Netflix, Hulu, Crunchyroll and Amazon Prime video might interest you. NO YOUTUBE APP STILL!6. OnlineNow you have to pay for plus to play online. I think it's worth it. You get free games across three platforms monthly. And they arent bad and old. They're good and fairly new games. You \"lose\" these games when your membership expires, but you can either become a member again to play them or just buy them (most likely at a lower price). Look up PS Plus for more details.7. Future FeaturesGaikai will supposedly allow you to play PS3 games on your PS4 and then PS3 games on your PS Vita and so on, but Sony haven't said anything about pricing. Will it be free, part of plus, separately paid for or do you have to repay for games? I don't know. Hopefully it will be either free or included with plus.8. ValueThe parts are 381$ for this 400$ system plus testing, labor to make (although it's cheap Chinese labor), shipping and packaging. This system is fairly priced and Sony may be losing money from every PS4 sold and making money from PS Plus and software sales. 400$ for the system is fair.Overall enjoying my ps4 and looking forward to the Japanese exclusives (mainly RPGs and JRPGs). Might want to check amazon every now and then if you want to buy a 400$ ps4. Act fast. They sell out quick. Have a ps3? I say keep it.

I tried to hook it up to the computer but the camera wouldn't turn on again at first then again it turn on. Unplugged it from the computer and it died again. My guess is the battery isn't charging from inside the camera. The only way to charge the battery is to hook up a USB cable to camera using a plug at the end. in other words there is NOT a separate charger. You use the camera to charge the battery. I cant say that is the problem with the camera. It just kept dying. I didn't want to fuss with it anymore nor do I think I should for a Brand New camera less than 12 hours old. Sending it back. Maybe a bad batch but I wanted to keep it but now I am Leary about the camera performance completely now. I own more cameras then I would like to disclose and NEVER had this problem.

(&lt;&lt;&lt; Update: On the 3rd day, my wrist pain started to come back.)* Pure plug-and-play. Load batteries (AAA x2, not included), plug in the receiver on a USB socket, turn the switch (on the bottom) on.* It looks and feels nice in that matte finish silk touch coating (which might peel off after a while,,, I don't know yet)* The middle wheel works as the scrolling wheel AND as a 4-direction scrolling pointer.* It has an automatic shut off after not being used for a while. I believe this prolongs the battery life. All you need is to click a buttononce to wake it up.* No software to install. The windows (mine's XP) mouse setup is good enough for all basic things.* Wireless seems to work fine (but my mouse and the receiver are in a close distance so it may not be a good test.)Cons:* The mouse too light and too slippery on my desk making it more difficult to target the pointer. My previous mouse was heavy and thus very easy to navigate WITHOUT pad. Now, I have to get a pad which I hate about using a mouse.* Designed for hands bigger than a certain size. My hands are not big. A bit difficult to use. For small handed (or short fingered) people, this mouse may not be the one to like.* Buttons much harder to click than normal type mouse. On the normal type, your fingers press the buttons against the support from desk. In this mouse, you're gonna need your thumb as the counter-support. All of a sudden, a simple clicking is rather a tricky task. Especially for small  handed people, it might be not as easy or comfortable.* It is high from the desk surface due to the purpose of the design. Thus, when I move your right hand between the mouse and the keyboard,  I kept knocking down the mouse until I finally learned the clearance. Some people might find it frustrating.* Not much of a manual however, not much of assembly required either. It is a very basic mouse. I discovered the middle wheel does more than vertical scroll by accident. I have one button I don't know what it is for. (&lt;&lt;&lt; Update:Turned out it is a \"DPI\" button. However, I didn't see any diffrence..., the inner package box have a button explanation.) No direction calibration available (which is a minor CON)SummaryI thought it was definitely easier on my wrist first but on the 3rd day, my wrist started aching again.And this product is not all so easier to use as a mouse for me so I have decided to return. I'm againsearch for a easy-on-your-wrist mouse. I tried trackball type but didn't work either...I give 2-stars to product + 1 more star because;* Anker vigorously tried to contact me in response to my original 3-star review including an email apparentlywritten by a human who had actually read my review. Isn't it better than those that never pay attention toreviews on their products?* I can not deny my review involves some subjective observations, which might not be a problem for other people.So, good luck in finding the best mouse for you, everyone!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "It didn't work for me", "unixReviewTime": 1393286400, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2014"}

Nearly every forum I visited had this monitor (or the older 2410) ranked as one of the best.  It was hard to see all that money leave my wallet but it has been worth every penny.  The reason I wanted to upgrade is simple, I wanted something that accurately reproduced colors, in the past I have struggled to get my work to look good on a variety of screens.  It was so bad that I actually didn't want to send my work to the clients as I never knew how it would look.  Luckily, that has all changed.The first thing that immediately struck me while I was unpacking it was the weight, this is not like the ~$100 monitors I have been using my whole life.  The build quality is absolutely perfect, it is obvious that they have not cut corners to reduce the manufacturing cost to pad their profit margins.  Then I plugged it in, wow the monitor looks just as great as you would imagine.  After a few minutes messing with the settings to get it to match my workflow I took a look at some of my older work to see if they colors were off.  They were off, a lot.The monitor is just a joy to work with. The stand allows you to move the monitor up and down approximately 9&#34; or so maybe more, the base swivels so you can rotate it to show someone what you are working on, and the screen can actually rotate to be in a portrait orientation rather than landscape (haven't found a need to use that but it is there if you need it).  It has some USB ports on it (very handy) and I think the other one is a card reader but I haven't had a chance to check that out yet.  The screen finish is also very nice, it is matte but not to the point that it is annoying if that makes sense.  Just the right amount to cut any glare or reflections without altering the look of whatever is on the screen.  Really great if you have windows behind you, some of the other monitors I have used are like a mirror.The only downside to this monitor is that you will never want to use a cheap $100 monitor again...I plan on buying a 2412m for use at work, cant stand that horrible monitor I have any longer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great High End Monitor For Photo/Video Work", "unixReviewTime": 1389744000, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2014"}
{"reviewerID": "A3BJL060L0KG3H", "asin": "B00BO8O9XQ", "reviewerName": "SD", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "I have been listening to this sub in a Subaru Forester paired with my Hybrid Audio Unity speakers for a couple of weeks now, and I am satisfied with it. I am now blown away - and don't expect to be - but the very noticeable gap in my audio spectrum is no longer missing.I chose this sub because I did not want to sacrifice any trunk space and I didn't want to do any battery modding to support some giant thumper. This sub fits cleanly under my passenger seat with room to spare, and comes with a handy remote that I velcro'd to the side of the center shifter area. The remote gives you control over sub power and low-pass frequency, which is great for tailoring the amount of bass you want for the track of the moment. It also glows high-tech blue -- albeit uselessly, since the light goes through two strips on the sides of the remote and not anywhere that makes the controls visible.As other reviewers have pointed out, the audio spectrum from this sub does cut out on the low-end. It does not hit very deep, which means those vibrations you get from really fancy setups that make your heart tremble are not to be found here. It does stay relatively clean though, and for the most part it is not boomy (although I do have to turn it down from time to time when boomy occurs).I set the low-pass frequency to cut off at 63 hz and set the high-pass for my mid-woofers to 65 hz. This makes the two blend nicely and keeps the sub from getting boomy and my mids from getting muddy. I keep the low-pass on the remote at 125 hz so the head-unit can stay in control and vary the sub power from 50-100% depending on what I'm listening to.I installed this sub myself, and it was the first time I really took a car apart. That made a fun (but nervous) experience, particularly with dealing with the battery. For those who are interested in doing this themselves, here are some things that I've learned that I hope can help you too.The videos on Crutchfield are a good start and cover most installation basics. Google 'Crutchfield Powered Subwoofer Install' to see.1) The manual that comes with this thing is very hard for a beginner to understand.But Google can answer most of your confusion. One thing in particular was that the blue P.Cont wire means Power Control -- it connects to the blue/white wire in your head unit sometimes called remote antenna.2) The connectors on these wires generally need to be removed and replaced with other terminals. Coming from building computers, I thought everything just snapped in place. Not really. Make sure you have all the tools you need going into this.3) These are the tools / parts:- RCA male to male cable (the 6ft HOSA sold on Amazon is a very good deal)- Wire cutter / stripper / crimper- Heat-shrink circular terminals for your ground and battery (get large, good ones rated for automobiles)- Heat-shrink connectors for splicing the sub wires to your head unit- A lighter or heat gun- Gloves when dealing with the battery- A decent ratchet set- Screwdrivers- Plastic no-scratch panel removal tools. In reality you just need a small set like http://www.amazon.com/No-Scratch-Audio-Refit-Panel-Removal/dp/B005909KWA- File, sand-paper or power grinder for exposing bare metal to your ground connection- Wire sleeve for protecting your power cable to the battery- Electrical tape (weather rated, >200 degrees f)- Google / YouTubeIt will also be good to have some light-duty zip-ties or velcro ties to organize your wires.4) Make sure you disconnect your battery any time you are dealing with live wires. I got lazy at one point and kept the battery connected when I moved my grounding cable and did some changes to my power line, and it ended up blowing the fuse.5) If you do something dumb and blow the fuse, at least fuses are cheap.6) Do not take your car's interior panels off without knowing exactly what you're doing. Google and visit online forums or find videos on YouTube that explain how to disassemble your specific car model for head-unit access and running wires to wherever you need to run them. It is very easy to break the clips or mess up something that will be expensive to replace if you don't know what you're doing.7) Heat-shrink terminals and connectors will work with a lighter - just use low heat and keep the flame as far as possible while still melting the plastic. You just don't want it to burn.8) Once you get everything installed, it's a great feeling to know how your car works and how to take the interior apart! I spilled a shake into my shifter a while ago and paid the mechanic over $100 to clean it out. I could have done it myself if I knew what I do now (and done a better job).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very compact, relatively simple setup, decent sound, affordable!", "unixReviewTime": 1395273600, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2014"}

The H6 sounded balanced but with less bass.So I settled with the H6. And I'm absolutely pleased I did.I listen to much more music with more bass,such as JPop, JRock. And while these headphones don't bring out the bass to a very high level, there is enough for me to accept. The clarity of the music is phenomenal with these headsets on! The sound isolation is enough for me to block out my roommate's keyboard (which he has Cherry Blue switches).Distortion? None that I can hear even at near full volume. Wearing glasses, too, and they do not press on my glasses. Very comfortable leather. Can wear for hours! Gorgeous looking headset.The cable with sound and song control is a huge plus and it works well on my iPhone and my rMBP.The audiophile is satisfied. If you looking for this pair of headphones to be bass-heavy, look elsewhere. If you're looking for the headphone that will ensures the maximum amount of clarity and precision in your music, I highly recommend these! $400 is a bit steep for a pair of headphones, but it is worth every penny.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Clarity For The Audiophile, Look For Bass Elsewhere.", "unixReviewTime": 1390003200, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2014"}

This is the monitor you always wanted at the price you thought was reasonable. Apple Cinema Display? No thanks--reflective nightmare. Lightboost TN? Meh--Colors are boring. Eizo Turbo240? Expensive and filled with flaws (I kept one for giggles). No sir, for those of us that want the fastest, prettiest pixels currently on the market, look no further.Pros: These monitors are better than anything you can buy with a standard namebrand on it for anything like normal money. This is a $1000 display, to be perfectly honest. The housing isn't even bad looking.Out of the box, the color is pretty much already neutral calibrated as it should be. Adjust the brightness to your liking and away you go. The lack of an on screen menu is a GOOD THING (it is a part of the reason the monitor has no input delay)Same goes for the single DVI-input--this also allows the monitor to overclock to 100Hz+ (works on modern AMD and NVidia cards)Very stable pixels. I've ordered 2 Perfect Pixel units from Ecomade Arena and both were 100% PP. No stuck, bright, dark, dead. Most people will tell you that even though they ordered a non perfect-pixel Qnix they ended up with one anyway.The 2 panels I received had very little IPS &#34;glow&#34; (this is a Samsung S-PLS panel, fewer quality issues than LG's IPS).Coating: Pleasant semi-gloss. Heavier than Eizo FG2421, but doesn't reflect much at all, while still being very very clear.Easy to Vesa mount, Easy to disassemble. Can get backlight bleeding, 1 of mine had almost none, 1 has a little but they are easy to adjust and fix the bleed completely almost if you disassemble. If not, it's really not an issue. I've seen worse bleed on pretty much every monitor I've bought in the last 2 years (and I buy a LOT of monitors).Even if these could not overclock, they would still be a tremendous value. *But* they can. So what does this mean? Wellllll the 8ms GtG pixel response time is usually a lie in the manufacturer's favor. In this case, it's in our favor because we can essentially overdrive the pixels in these displays to respond at about 4ms (for real, yo) which makes a huge difference for tracking objects in motion on the screen------like your mouse cursor or scrolling text. For me... it's a lot less eye straining, and a lot easier to see what I'm doing while happily wasting time shooting things in computer games. But it's also just great all the time, I prefer browsing at 100Hz, I prefer watching YouTube at 100Hz. It's just better.Amazon resellers are not making a huge amount of money per unit. These are very inexpensive displays. Don't cheat yourself out of a good unit by trying to get the absolute rock-bottomist price on one of these possible; even going the route I did, you are getting enormous value.Cons: It's DUAL LINK DVI only. If you don't have dual link dvi it's a no go. Some people can get them to work off Macs and some can't--it's about what you have specifically hardware wise and you need to do some research to make sure it can be used. I've even heard about some success with a certain kind of active adapter so who knows. Now, I have DVI-D and DVI-I on my Nvidia cards, and they both work with these monitors because they are both dual link versions of DVI outputs. It's important to make sure your card has dual link DVI-D or DVI-I *because* there are single link DVI-D and DVI-I outputs on some older cards and those wont work.Depth of dark detail: Not bad, not great. I had a brand new AOC Q2770PQU sitting next to my Qnix and even though the Qnix had a better contrast ratio, the grayscale was quite a bit better on the AOC. The AOC is at least 200 dollars more and is stuck at 60Hz though, so that was an easy choice.Stand: K, this is weird, I bought two of these and they weren't the same height. The stand isn't as wobbly as I had heard, but it leaves something to be desired. It can also be easily replaced, but I like it just fine. Just not clear why they are not the same exact length here lol. Anyway, it does actually tilt, and it holds itself up just fine. My desk is solid heavy oak and it doesn't budge when I bump it, so the monitor doesn't either, but the stand has rubber pads on the bottom that are good at sticking to lacquered desks; it's a much better stand than I expected, actually.Other thoughts:Seriously consider buying an accidental coverage plan along with a squaretrade warranty the moment your purchase goes through, even before it arrives. I scratched the screen on my first Qnix slightly (right after I got it) and I will regret it for much of the rest of my life. I sold it to a friend for a big loss. :(The replacement, like the original, arrived in less than 2 business days from when I placed the order.

Unfortunately my video cards generated too much heat inside the case, and I decided it would be better to split them into 2 systems. Now my sytem is super quiet, efficient and has plenty of GPU power to run whatever I want.Here are some facts you need to know when picking out equipment for a build.1) Never exceed 400 watts of (video cards) power, which translates directly into heat produced, in an enclosed case with air cooling. Your main PCIE16 card will be hotter because of radiant heat from the second card. This will make card 1 throttle more to control the heat, which will equal bad performance. (This exponentially multiplies with more cards.)  It will also lead to all your fans running at 100%  2+ high end video cards (above 200 watts each) I reccommend liquid cooling the GPU's.  Reference \"hamster fans\" are extremey loud and sound like a hair dryer running, I do not recomended them.2) It is fine to overkill your Power supply! Honestly you should double the wattage of the PS to what you think you will use. It allows for growth and overclocking if you want.  Power Supplies run most efficiently at 50% of thier rated wattage and once you hit 70% efficiency goes down fast, while heat increases.3) One 24vdc rail is the best, and most versatile for multiple video card setups because you do not waist power.4) Fully Modular is the ONLY way to go5) Spend the extra money on a GOLD standard power supply, you will have a super stable and reliable system because you did.6) NEVER use power supply cables from ANOTHER power supply, because they can be wired different at the PS. USE ONLY THE POWER CONNECTORS THAT ARE SUPPLIED with this POWER SUPPLY.

My initial config is with two 4TB Red drives mirrored, will add drives later for fault tolerance later.Me: I've used Windows Home Server - home built RAID 5 (no DE as it was a bad idea from the onset) - as my NAS device. Backup and restore were dead simple and as a file server no complaints. I ran it using Hamachi VPN to connect remote computers. I've worked in the internet security industry in development and know my fair share about network setup and config. I liked WHS because I know Windows the OS and could always augment it services if I needed.Synology Disk Station is more of a closed OS - if it doesn't do what you need, you can't add an app to the OS itself, even though it is built on a Unix Core.

It will take a while to work my way through the device.

WHS had an awesome backup program built in that could easily be installed to each computer. Synology has several options, but I haven't tried them yet.What this means for the average home user?  Well, it is easy to install the drives and get it up and running if you just want to share drives. Still, you will have to know a thing or two about Users and Passwords to get your family to see it.In the end, the best thing about this unit compared to my WHS is the size.

Fritz", "helpful": [228, 266], "reviewText": "We were saving up for this TV because we heard so many good things about it.  Finally, with $40k in the bank we got online to order it and coincidentally came across an ad for a girl named Amanda in her early teens for only $10K.  Her parents were trying to purchase the same awesome 4K TV and needed the cash.Now, let me clarify a few things here.  First, the last time we had a daughter she cost a hell of a lot more than $10K...As a matter of fact, her college expenses this year alone are more than triple that amount.  So, Amanda was a bargain!  Second, since our daughter is away at college we kinda missed having the attention of a young one in the house.  And third, my wife isn't that much into TV, house cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, laundry or other chores and when she saw we could have another daughter \"slave\" for only $10K her mind was set!  Oh, but here's the main selling point...We only have to keep her for a year!!!  Then when those teenage hormones really start kicking in - she's her parents problem again.  What a deal!!!*******Due to an overwhelming response to this review I've have no choice but to add this amendment:First, Amanda is a sweet, kind, fun loving, young human being and should be treated like one.  As soon as her year is up in our servitude that will no doubt be the case.  But, due to the contract we made with her parents she is to be returned to them at the end of the year.  So, conversely we are not allowed to sell, sub-rent or lease her out to anyone else.  Please understand and stop requesting.We are saving up again for the TV.  There were a few hidden costs in receiving Amanda that we didn't plan for.  The plane ticket alone was close to $700 - and we still have to look at the return flight.  Hopefully we will book it much earlier this time now that we know when she is to be returned.  And, Amazon is trying to get us to pay an online sales tax on her purchase.  We are currently disputing that because this is more of a rental than a purchase.  And, even with Amazon Prime and the cost of Amanda being more than $35 we still had to pay for shipping ourselves ($700 plane ticket).But, the good news, we are now only $5K away from a new 4K TV!  Cutting our daughter's college funding really helps us save!********What a sad day!  Quite emotional for all of us.  Our year with Amanda is up and we just dropped her off at the airport.  She's heading back home to her parents.  We are really going to miss her.  She made such an impact in our lives.  Our dogs loved her, we enjoyed watching our 1080 HDTV with her, and we got to really enjoy having Amanda in our home and part of our daily lives.  Amanda was a little chatty at first but we took a few measures to quiet her down.  My wife and Amanda began to get close - she even showed Amanda a few makeup tips.  My wife is still crying in the living room - she really got used to it being cleaned everyday.For myself, I really miss the way dinner was prepared every night when I got home or that I never had to get up and get a beer for myself.  Now I have to get used to walking the dogs again, too.  Nothing is going to be the same around here now that she's gone.  Darn, I just realized it's trash day - haven't worried about that for a year!But, the good news is after we finally saved up $40K we found a refurbished 4K TV for only $30K.  Unfortunately, though, James and his wife didn't want to extend our contract.  Looks like we may be paying for our daughter to go back to college and finish her degree after all.  She'll appreciate that a lot!Thanks for all the hard work Amanda - you were the best \"daughter\" we ever spent $10K on!Oh, and the 4K TV is AWESOME - it takes up two walls!  We saved the box, too.

We had pretty tight size requirements, and the H/K 1510 was one of very few receivers that would actually fit.

It looks beautiful, takes up very little space, and sounds great.  I have it hooked up to a pair of Wharfedale Diamond 10.2 speakers crossed over at 80hz to a subwoofer, and the combination sounds fantastic powered by this receiver.  Better, in fact, than my much more expensive speakers powered by a much more expensive (and powerful) Pioneer Elite receiver (stating opinion here, but I loved that more expensive setup too).The good: Inexpensive, small & light, beautiful, sounds great.  On-screen menu is straight-forward and makes sense to navigate.The bad: Not as full-featured as some other receivers, not as powerful as some other receivers, cheap non-front-channel speaker connections.The bottom line is that I can't imagine a better-sounding receiver at this price, and the fact that it's small, light and stylish is icing on the cake.  You could pay more and get some more features, but if you're looking for some simple amplification and video switching you'd be hard-pressed to do better.

I waited a few days to explore the phone myself, so as to hopefully have some &#34;intelligent&#34; questions, and it was a pleasure.  Although you categorize the areas you want to discuss, you're free to ask whatever you like, so you can effectively use your phone.  The Nokia representative was efficient, knowledgeable and friendly - i.e., real customer service.  And they said I was free to call any time as a Nokia owner.  Nice!-Although the 521 lacks a couple of things that would be nice, such as a magnetometer for true location services, a front-facing camera, etc., with my provider, T-Mobile, it has several advantages, such as WiFi calling.  I bought this phone specifically to replace my old Nokia E-series and to use with T-Mobile's so-called &#34;Wal-Mart Plan.&#34;  $30/month, 100 minutes of calling, unlimited text and data (up to 5gb at 4g) - perfect for me.As for the returns, the first was likely not the phone but the SIM card.  Nonetheless, T-Mobile suggested returning all and starting fresh.  I considered that solid advice.  Second, probably a battery, but again, with the sane advice of Nokia, they suggested a complete reset.  I will say this, the recovery was much less painful with Nokia/MS Windows phone's OS than I expected.  If you log in via an MS account, and allow them to save/update your system, such occurrences (which happen with all variety of phones!) is not so painful.I recommend, but again, I'm NOT an apple fan, nor much of an Android fan, either.Bottom line: Find another phone with this much functionality and utility for this price point.

I have purchased other MBs (and other products) over the years from ASUS and this is the first one I can say did not work as advertised right out of the box. First of all I noticed the main PCI slot had a broken tab on it (I should have boxed it up right then), but figured what's a piece of plastic. Then I noticed it was missing one of the SATA cables, it was supposed to have 4 (I believe), there was only 3. Hmmmm.After putting everything together (fans, CPU, memory, etc.) the board posted good. Opened the bios, and all checked good. Had a new HD I wanted to use so I started loading Windows 7 (64bit)onto it. Halfway thru the installation Blue Screen Of Death (BSOD). Shut it down; retried it and at the 3/4 portion of the install ... BSOD. Here's a long story short 'cause I troubleshot this thing for many hours with no success... I have multiple HDs, so I tried them all to make sure it was not the new drive I had brought. Same exact error at different points during the Win 7 Install. Even ran memtest86 at one point to make sure the RAM wasn't bad. Finally I had to borrowed a friends computer and I downloaded ASUS most recent BIOS for this board and updated it. Same errors... no change. (Why this didn't come with the latest BIOS is beyond me. Anyways)Called ASUS tech support just to get confirmation of what I thought was bad. (WOW... 3 times waiting on hold for over 10mins each time and then I get the \"please leave a message and one of our reps will get back to you\". \"Oh wait you can't because all mail boxes are full,\" goodbye.  REALLY ASUS!!! Really?)  Anyways, I finally got thru the forth time after waiting OVER another 10 MINs for a tech. He confirmed my thoughts that I had a bad motherboard (probably the SATA controller).Now I'm waiting for Amazon to ship me a new board. (BTW... Amazons return/exchange process is A1 so far.) So besides all the above here my main reason for giving such a low rating. The inconvenience and hassle this has caused and the time wasted troubleshooting a BRAND NEW PRODUCT. Nothing should be so much hassle. I understand that sometimes things go bad on items, Especially when it comes to Electronics (I have over 30 yrs experience in the field), but the QA process is supposed to catch most stuff.

I have come to expect the BEST from ASUS in the past, but this experience so far has left a really bad taste in my mouth.I'll update this review after I get my new board, and we'll see. If the new board works like this one did, I'll take my business to another MFR.UPDATE 14 Jan 14 - This ding is on Amazaon. Above I said they have been A1 on this issue... Well I'm changing that. Come to find out it's going to take over 2+ wks for Amazon get a replacement MB to me even though there are 13 instock shown on amazon at this time. WHAT? Their reason is because they have to get the new MB from their suppier (not out of their wharehouse) and it's no longer 2 day shipping because of that also. I don't care about their suppier issues. I brought a MB with 2 day shipping... not 2 + Weeks shipping. What if I was running a business and could not run my business without a computer.

Amazon should be getting this replacement board to me ASAP to close out this issue. More to come on this review I'm sure. Shame on you Amazon!!!!!!UPDATE 16 Jan 2014 - Decided to cancel the replacement MB and cancel this order completely.

For super clear hi fidelity listening, I whip out my Bose Quiet Comforts or V-Moda Crossfade headphones. When wanting to travel light or do activities outdoors, I'll use my Beats Powersports or Rockford Fosgate Punch Plugs. (by the way, if I keep a pair of headphones for longer than a few weeks, they are good headphones. otherwise I sell or return them) I bought the Skullcandy Crusher's after demo'ing them in Best Buy. I immediately had to have them after feeling the bass response. I used to have a pair of cheap headphones that had this effect, but they eventually broke and I found out no headphone manufacturer was doing this \"trick\" any more. Having a driver vibrate the headphones in time to bass frequencies fools your brain into thinking it is hearing massive bass. In car audio competitions, they used to sell vibration \"amps\" that mount under each seat to fool people into feeling/hearing the bass much harder than the speakers are actually playing. The same thing is happening inside these Crusher headphones. The main reason people keep buying higher and higher end headphones these days is to upgrade the bass response. It is very tough to get massive bass from smaller speakers. Skullcandy has figured out a way to \"cheat\" and the results are incredible. I'm surprised more companies aren't doing this same trick. I never thought I would say that headphones can have too much bass, but these can hit a ridiculous levels. It isn't ever uncomfortable or too distorted, but you can make these headphones have an over-powering bass response to where songs sound almost comical. These were made for dub-step. Most users I know will play with the novelty of turning the bass slider to max when they first get them, but eventually you will want to hear all of the song and not just the bass end by keeping the slider at 1/2 to 3/4 settings. The mids and highs are very acceptable too. No distortion unless you are blowing up the bass slider to max. The sound you get out of these headphones is worth FAR more than $99. I can't imagine the amount of bass these will have once the speakers reach their prime \"break-in\" period. To keep this review simple... if you want the most bass you can get from headphones and don't want to spend $500+ to do it, buy these now. The only reason I didn't give this product a 5 star rating was that after an hour or so of listening, it felt like it was crushing my head. They seem a little tight, but that might get better over time. If you have a small/medium head, they might be fine for you. One of the other great features of these headphones are the auto-on/off circuit for the bass driver. Stopping your music or unplugging the cord will turn off the battery powered amplifier circuit. This insures you get the max battery life. I never liked headphones that had a manual on/off switch because you'd always forget. Also, considering what is packed into these headphones, they are rather light. They don't dent your hair like other heavier headphones. If you have a specific question on these, message me. I'd be glad to answer back.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Hands down, the MOST bass you can get out of headphones.", "unixReviewTime": 1401667200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2014"}

I think they could have used a better intray as the plastic feels a bit cheap. Below the IEM's you'll find the carry case and underneath the intray is the manual and warranty papers.Overall quite nice packaging but could be better.Build quality is good on these, the housing is all metal with great strain relief on both the jack and entry to the housing, the iPhone Mic is metal with a good quality button and i have no real complaints about the build quality, the cable does tangle a bit and has a little memory effect.Accessories included are also great, with a semi-hard clamshell case, 6 pairs of different silicone tips and a cable clip (useful to keep cable noise down).Comfort, Isolation, Cable noise and Driver flex:Comfort is good once you get a good seal, the shape of the housing lets you get quite deep insertion but they are more comfy with shallow insertion, and you do have to adjust them from time to time, it is very important to get a good seal with these, they are very seal dependent and it took me a while to get a good fit.Isolation is not a strong point of the M-DUO, it is below average and i suspect it is because of the vented nature of these IEM's and also the housing maybe.Cable noise is present, not too bad but i would recommend using the cable clip to reduce cable noise.Driver flex is also present but not a big problem and adjusting them solves this.Sound:Lows:With a dedicated woofer for the lows i was expecting big bass, but after listening for a while, that was not the case. The bass is definitely north of neutral but it's not overpowering. Superb punch in the mid-bass with it extending effortlessly down passed 20hz, these have amazing capability in the lows. You can feel the rumble in the sub-bass but it's never too much, neither does it drown everything out, I guess that's due to the dedicated woofer. The lows are not the fastest or the tightest, but they certainly are fun.Mids:These have a slight V shaped signature so the mids are behind the lows and highs, but the mids are clear and detailed, never sounding veiled or muffled. There is a spike in the upper-mids which can lead to some sibilance and harshness in female vocals but its not too bad and should only affect the most sensitive of ears.Highs:Highs are good in general, they have good presence and sparkle but extension could be better. Because of the spike in the upper-mids you get the perceived extra detail, but real extension leaves a little to desire. The highs are not particularly airy and they become a little splashy sometimes but for the price they fair well.Soundstage, Imaging and Instrument separation:The soundstage is good with it being both fairly wide and with good height.Instrument separation is fairly good but there is not much air between the different instruments.Imaging is very good though giving off great spacial queues and sounds are easily pinpointed.Conclusion:Slight V-shaped sound sig with an overall fun and enjoyable sound with no major faults.

I have tried a few of their products now and, like the others, I think this one excellent. The unit has a good capacity of 5200mAh which is enough to charge most mobile phones 2 or 3 times or a tablet once - although it depends on your individual device, of course - which makes it a really useful thing to have around.It is very simple to use. Just plug the micro-USB lead supplied (or any other micro-USB lead) into a USB port and the micro-socket on the power bank and it charges at a slightly leisurely 1A.  (There is a US-style SSB charger supplied with the power bank).  It takes about 6 hours for a full charge and the level of charge is shown by the normal 4 small LEDs.  Using the power bank to charge your device is just as simple. Just plug your device's USB lead into the power bank, switch and your device will charge at pretty well the same rate as if you charged it in the normal way.The unit also has a little LED flashlight which is pretty bright and a handy thing to have in your bag when fumbling for keys on a dark night or the like.  It's a nice little bonus.This seems like a very good-quality product.  Leakage rate is very low and if the claims of 500+ charge/discharge cycles are true (which they usually are for this type of battery) that's a good long life.  It is light at 125g, robust and elegant.  It's a compact and slim at 9cm x 4cm x 2cm so it will slip pretty easily into a pocket or handbag.I really like this power bank. My one complaint is that the English in the user manual is very poor.

I see the 5Ghz SSID, because we have to change the SSID name for 5Ghz manually, not like the Apple, there is an option to check to activate the 5Ghz channel at the page where you create the SSID/password.In my case, I created the SSID/password... etc under wireless setting, then I will have to go to the AP configuration(this is in another tab) --> WLAN --> n/a(problem here,  why there is no \"ac\" there? I wish I could post the screenshot here) --> change the name to something else, like 5Ghz then connect to it...But the result is very bad... I was asking one of the staff there to use the iPhone to connect to it, with N@2.4Ghz, he has 97% signal, with AC@5Ghz, it dropped to 57%...I will go there and check the actual mbps speed.I will still get Unifi AP but not AC...

I am very disappointed with the speed(mbps).I would rather go for the lowest version since the AC is not in function, why would I spend 300bucks for just b/g speed.I have the Time Capsule(AC) at home, and I am connected as AC with 867mbps.If someone can point out the correct AC setting for me, please help.==================2014 0615Finally, I have time to do testing with it.I am testing it with a 2013 Macbook Air(AC wireless ready).The coverage is really good with this one, I am always with 90% and back then I have around 50% at the same spot.BUT I can't get AC working?!

Same results with bouncing the flash off the ceiling. The photos are even more underexposed when I'm zooming in on the subject.However, If I use Flash Exposure Lock(FEL) before snapping the photo, they all come out looking great, zooming in or not. Without using FEL, the pictures are way underexposed.If I use the same flash setup in the flash's manual mode, without using FEL, and adjust the power down to say 1/2 or 1/4 or somewhere in between, the photos seem properly exposed (as long as I dial in the correct flash power adjustment). With a zoom that has a variable aperture, it's a hit and miss approach and quite cumbersome.Also, I tried the same lenses attached to my Canon T3i taking the same photos as I did with the 70D using the same flash and diffuser without using FEL. The photos all came out looking perfect with no underexposure whatsoever. Then I tried using FEL with the T3i. There was no difference between using FEL and not using it on my T3i. All photos with and without FEL were properly exposed and looked great.I use bounce flash indoors a lot for our one year old granddaughter. I never had this problem, or any other issue, with my T3i. I guess I'll have to resort to FEL use, but that amount flashes takes a toll on an infant. She begins to cry after a few photos if I'm using FEL for each one. Plus, it's hard to get candid shots when an FEL pre-flash is being used.This isn't what I bargained for when I \"upgraded\" my camera body.I'm now wondering if this will negatively effect exposures on outside fill flash photos with a diffuser attached.The fact that Canon hasn't addressed this yet is disconcerting to say the least.

I received an obviously used camera.  Yes, I bought it direct from Amazon and not from a third party.  I took it out of the box and the Live View mode wasn't working reliably: I had to reset the camera twice by pulling the battery out in the first few hours of use.  I asked Amazon for a replacement.By comparing the original to the replacement, it became obvious that I was shipped a product that someone else had already used, and possibly returned due to the problems I saw.  Here are signs you can use if you suspect similar:-The USB cable and neck strap should be sealed in individual plastic bags.  Mine were loose.-The manuals should be sealed.  There should be a CD and several errata and warranty cards loose.  Mine were all loose.-The used camera had the battery fully charged.  The replacement started charging from 0-49%.-The rear lens cap on the kit lens was marred noticeably.-The shutter would click when the live view button was pressed, but the LCD screen would stay blank.  The only way to recover from this was to remove and reseat the battery.-The first camera was set up to shoot RAW.  The default out of the box is typically jpeg.-Images taken with the camera were numbered starting at 2561 instead of 0001.-The date was set on the first camera.  The replacement asked me to set date and time.To their credit, Amazon made it right quickly and without cost to me, but the fact that it happened at all is a bit of a shock.  At the end of the day, trust the glowing reviews of this product.  It's a great camera with an outstanding feature set.  Just don't unknowingly get someone else's problem.

There are an exhaustive number of great reviews on both already so I'll keep it brief.The iPad mini simply doesn't compare. This Nexus has far better hardware. It runs faster than iPad mini, by far and the internet loads far more quickly. AppStore loads way slower than Google Play on Nexus and downloads are much faster on Nexus even though both are on the same network.Cosmetically, I prefer the wide screen format of Nexus over iPad's older screen dimension.  The clarity is clearly better on Nexus too. Also, the text on iPad is minuscule to the point of being annoying. I enabled large fonts and even went into the Accessibility options and activated the largest text and bold, and still the fonts are about 6pt at best. Very inconvenient. Nexus isn't like that and I find it much easier to read. Activating the dark background on iPad did help some though. The screen just isn't as vibrant as Nexus. iPad does have a decent 3 finger tap zoom feature, but it sorely needs to be improved in this arena.  Nexus also has zoom features, but I find I don't really need it, where as, with iPad, it's an absolute must.Graphic intensive games play far better on Nexus than iPad, though I will say the overall game quality seems to be a tad better on iPad.  Angry Birds is Angry Birds. It renders faster on Nexus, but iPad seems to have a more interesting selection of apps I've never seen before. But I'm new to iPad so maybe the App Store is just more of a novelty right now.  I will say that I find Google Play far easier to navigate and more pleasing to the eye.  And generally, App Store's free apps seem to be riddled with heavy handed advertising. You see that on some Google Play apps too, but not as aggressively as iPad.I have always considered myself an Android guy, and in all honesty, I don't see that changing.  I have an 8.9\" Fire HDX for personal use and this Nexus and my iPad for work.  I'd say that iPad has done nothing to sway me over to iOS. I like it, but it just doesn't hold a match to either HDX or Nexus, as far as user experience and power.  If I had to pick just one, I'd say this Nexus is the winner, due to the specs and form factor.I got my iPad mini for a great deal at 230 brand new. But it's only 16gb and has less than half the computing power of Nexus.  I paid 221 for my Nexus and it's 32gb. This Nexus just offers way more for the money than iPad, which typically can't be had new for under $270.Having used both iPad mini and Nexus on a daily basis for work -- hands down, Nexus is the clear winner in price, function, usability and quality. Not even close. Sorry iPad.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nexus vs iPad Mini", "unixReviewTime": 1402185600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2014"}

Zone is just an area of the house which can hold multiple sensors. They are pre-set to a certain description that may or may not match the actual area. Zones are labelled as window, door, fire, hall etc. It's doesn't interfere with the functionality of the system, but I like to have accurate descriptions of the zones such as Kitchen, Bedroom, Living room etc. This makes the system more neat if I could tell where exactly the break in/ false alarm happened.- The main console doesn't tell which sensor triggered the alarm. So each zone can have up to 10 sensors. It would be very convenient if the main console identified which sensor sent the trigger signal. It would be even better if I could label each sensor separately (such as kitchen door, backyard door, bedroom window, hallway motion sensor). It does identify the zone, but that doesn't tell me a whole lot in terms of preventing false alarms. I have had a few false alarms, they were mostly due to family members who were roaming around the house, but one or two false alarms happened in the middle of the night when everyone was asleep. I have a theory that it was the motion sensor that picked up something like a bug crawling over it, but I can't confirm it because the main console doesn't tell me which sensor was responsible for the alarm.- The key fobs are old fashioned and very basic. The system can be controlled by a keyfob that comes with it (this one comes with three). The four keys on it can disarm, arm at home, arm when leaving, and sound the alarm. The keys have to be pressed with a bit of pressure. I advised all the family members to press and hold it for at least half a second to let the system disarm/arm. The keys can be pressed really quickly and the red LED lights up as if the signal was sent, but it doesn't send the signal. A quick tap almost never sends the signal. The key has to be pressed down for at least half a second with some pressure for it to work. And when it does work, there is no way to tell if the system is disarmed unless you are next to the console and hear it say \"system disarmed\". I have a few people who live in a part of the house that's on the opposite side of the console. For them there is no way to tell if the system is disarmed in case they need to get to the bathroom or something in the middle of the night. There is no feedback on the keyfobs to determine the state of the system. Personally I rather have an app to control it, which brings me to my next point.The connectivity is archaic. Yes the fact that there is GSM connectivity on this alarm system is not that impressive. It can send and receive text messages, and make phone calls and can be armed/ disarmed with a text message, but that is simply not enough in today's world. We live in the era of Nest thermostats and smart phones. I would like the system to have wifi connectivity and be able to communicate to my smart phone over the internet. I would also like to get an app that can do everything that the main console does (ok not everything but things that I do on a daily basis such as arm/disarm/ check logs and reports). I like to get notifications if the alarm has been triggered. I know I can get a phone call or a text message through GSM, but that requires additional monthly fee for the cellular service. I also know that a call can be made via the landline as well, but I rather get notifications on my phone instead. Having a configuration page for the alarm system (like printers do) would make configuration setup much easier as well. I don't see why it still cannot be done. They can simply introduce a wireless IP module that can program the main console wirelessly. Once the IP module is up and running it can use the internet connection to communicate with the phone.These are just some suggestions and ideas to improve on this system. I am personally happy with the purchase so far and the system works as advertised. It's just small things that can be improved to make the user experience even better. I am still giving the system a four star rating which means it's a pretty decent system.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent alarm system with a lot of room for improvement", "unixReviewTime": 1391472000, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2014"}

While there are plenty of 27&#34; monitors that look good, I was after monitors that had color depth and fidelity.  It came down to Asus vs ViewSonic.  Both were highly-regarded for their price range, but ViewSonic was back-logged until forever.  So Asus it was.I broke the monitors in on my older Mac Pro (DVI).  Single-channel DVI won't carry the full resolution of the screen, but results were encouraging.  The new Mac showed up a couple of weeks ago and I hooked it up with Thunderbolt/Display port cables. My-oh-my! They're certainly quick enough (I'm not a gamer, so I don't drive that aspect particularly hard) and the color fidelity is excellent.  These are factory calibrated.  I do wonder what will happen as they age.  I have a colorimeter, but I don't know if it has enough resolution to help with these monitors.  I suppose we'll see when the time comes.  At the moment it looks great and detail on my photographs shows up crisply.  Gradients look very nice.Most monitors these days also provide USB ports.  In the majority of cases, those are USB-2.  The inclusion of USB-3 on these Asus monitors is a nice bit of future thinking.  Hoods are also included (I didn't notice that part in the writeup) so it's easier to control glare from room lights.  There are also cables for every format supported by the monitor--on the short side to be sure--but most people keep the computer fairly close by their workspace.Another review complains about this monitor on Mac, but he/she was using HDMI.  Don't.  HDMI doesn't carry the full resolution of this monitor, so anything you see will be upscaled from a regular HD resolution.

Much of my prior work which involved tedious routines almost become automatic with this machine. The thing that swayed me over others like the  Sony and Samsung, Canon and Nikon units with interchangeable lenses was the viewfinder which those other choices lacked. The camera will require a lot of work on my part to get back to my prior level of expertise but that is due to the amazing electronic capabilities built into the camera; it takes some practice to become automatic. Why not 5 stars?

The ethernet method was quick though and frankly, I preferred to do it that way anyway. I was only giving the push button a shot to see if it worked. I put the extender in my den where signal to devices was very low most of the time and right off the bat, signal was now excellent there and everywhere in the house in fact. The problem though is the signal on it was only two bars which is not recommended, and a speed test showed that to be true- horrible at DL 3.09 and UL at 4.44. So I moved it to my laundry room, where the signal remains high showing full bars. Even though the extender is in that closed room and not out in the open in the den, the signal on all devices is very good to excellent and speed tests now show DL at 17.41 and UL at 5.29. This for me is respectable. So be advised, the extender will show excellent signal to devices even if the extender itself is showing only 2 bar signal, which is sub par. Do not call it a day with that. Move the extender around until it shows good signal itself. THEN you're really getting the benefit. And don't let a wall stop you from choosing a location for it. If the signal is strong to the extender, it'll still be optimal in other rooms as well. In my den now where signal was very low, it's now excellent and web pages and videos, hbogo, netflicks, chromecast, etc is WAY better. Excellent!UPDATE- It crashed my network once, so the next thing I did was to update the firmware right away. All has been solid now. It was one firmware rev behind, out of the box. Updating it was very easy. So I think it's a good idea to update the firmware if you have any issues. Wireless is blazing now at 20/5.53 speed tests. Love it so far! Will update my review if I need to.UPDATE 2- Network crashed again today and my netbook drops connection and recovers quickly, but still drops out frequently enough to be a bother. I've since moved the extender to a spot where it's at full strength and it provides great signal to the areas that need it. Speed tests are great too. But I'm afraid the inconsistency of my wireless network because of this extender will ultimately make me pull this out of line entirely. I enjoyed a solid wireless network with a new router in line recently, albeit with some parts of the house with low signal. I'd rather have that than suffer through frequent wireless interruptions. I'll update again with my final findings, but the next one will be to drop my rating to one star and tell you to avoid this product. I'm leaving my initial review really liking this thing as a lesson- what happens in the first 12 hours using a product means virtually nothing. It's all about longevity. I'm using this product exactly as I should, even coupling it with a brand new TPlink router and it's been problematic. If two TPlink products can't work well with each other, than I don't know what to say. Will update again shortly either way.FINAL UPDATE- Not one minute after writing the second update, another wireless disconnect. So that's it- done. I wanted this to work in the worst way but it doesn't. I can only advise that in my experience, just plain avoid it- very sorry to say.

I bought this to replace my Nikon Coolpix.  I had my coolpix for just over 12 months when it broke, due to no fault of my own, and it was going to cost $150 to repair.  Rather than repair a camera that I liked but didn't love, I decided to make a new purchase.My initial intention was to purchase a Canon Rebel, I have used my mom's in the past and really love that camera.  I loved using the interchangeable lenses and the ability to manually focus.  Seeing the cost though ($500+,) plus the cost of additional lenses, it just wasn't in my price range at the moment and I needed a new camera urgently.  If you're looking for a DSLR, do not expect this to function the same.  It's a powerful little camera, but it is NOT a DSLR.  If you're an amateur photographer and have no intention of taking a class to learn how to use the functions of a DSLR, this is a perfect camera for you.So began my research.  It became a toss up between the Canon SX510 and the Nikon L820.  Reviewers were split between the two, some preferring the Nikon, some preferring the Canon.  They seemed to come out about even except in a few minor categories, and having been very pleased with the Canon Rebel, I decided to go with the Canon despite it costing about $30 more than the Nikon.Pro's-*30x Optical zoom - awesome, no more grainy pictures of kids on stage during performances*Built in wifi - go ahead and upload your pics to facebook, send them to your phone, or directly to your wireless printer.*Manual setting - can do your own iso settings, white balance, shutter speed etc.  The auto setting works fabulously in most cases, far better than any camera I've ever owned, but the option is there for those times it's just not adjusting quite how you want it.*CMOS sensor provides for a clearer image, especially on the macro setting, than my own eyes give me.*Zoom assist - for when you use your 30x zoom but lose your subject*Size - for anyone that has gone hiking with a DSLR and multiple lenses, you know what a pain that can be.  This lighter camera is perfect for running around and still has a lot of the qualities that you'd look for in a DSLR.  So unless you're out taking professional shots, this comes in really handy*Discreet mode - This is a setting on the dial, great for those events when there is no flash allowed.  In this mode, the camera doesn't make noise when turning it on, nor does the flash go off.  Even if the camera goes off and you turn it back on, because it is set on the dial, it doesn't reset itself.  I've accidentally had my flash turned back on so many times that way on previous cameras.Cons -*Very poor manual - A lot of skipping around to get one thing done.  IE Looking through the start up manual, it says \"for instructions on attaching (the lens cap cord and neck strap) please see the user manual on the canon website\"  Granted, it wasn't difficult to figure out, but there was no clear spot for the lens cap cord, and it is something that should have been included in a \"start-up\" manual.  Another example of a poor manual, referring to the downloadable pdf manual...say you want to learn how to use the miniature setting...so it says \"miniature setting, pg 48\"  You go to pg 48 and it says to follow steps 1 and 2 on page 46....okay back to page 46, got that down, back to page 48.  It seems to be this way when trying to learn how to access any of the features.  I can't fault the actual camera for this, but definitely Canon.  I actually made up my own cheat sheet for accessing my favorite features until I have it down.*No ability to manually focus - Being that this camera is not a DSLR, I didn't expect or really even hope for this feature.  I would have liked it, but for the $$, I definitely can't complain and will upgrade in the future.*Mirrorless - I would definitely prefer to use a viewfinder, I am used to going without though, so it's easy to work around.*No Raw Shooting - this feature doesn't apply to most people, but sometimes I prefer to use it*No Touch Screen - This is taking time for me to get used to, I find myself constantly tapping the screen.  My last 2 cameras, going back to 2010, have been touch screen, so I'm surprised to find this camera doesn't have one.Some reviewers have complained about the difficulty of accessing the wifi, this was fairly easy for me and took about 15 minutes max.  It's a little more work than it typically takes to connect a device to wifi,and you have to use the computer to do it, but it's still not overly difficult.Despite the cons, I'm still incredibly impressed with this camera and it has definitely earned 5 stars when taking into account the type of camera, the construction, and the value.  I'm very happy with this purchase despite the fact that I was hoping for my next camera to be the Rebel.  I never imagined I'd get a camera of this level of quality for under $400.

If you notice with the Px4's you have the ability to change the angle at which sound is coming in at you using the \"Surrounding Angles\" however for me i couldn't tell anything was happening at least to a degree of notice. There is no chat vol control for the Mic on this headset, as well the paperwork is lacking in that its just not enough to explain how everything works, there is no chart that explains what Beep number sound means what for sound settings on the left side of the headset.So here it isPros:-It works on the Ps4 (Only with the 3.5mm / 2.5mm double jack from headset to controller)-It's price can be cheaply bought if you don't go to GameStop (they are selling these for 159.99 and upwards here in VA)-The 5.1 dolby digital system is not that bad for the price.Cons:-Blue Tooth as of and before 2/28/2014 still is not working for the Ps4 system even tho it says you can connect (maybe its my system only i don't know)-There can be a lot of Fuzz when you connect the Jack to your Ps4 gaming Controller sometimes which for me means i have to leave a chat and reconnect or turn off the headset and or system which it to much lol.-Only reason we're buying these is all headset companies asked the Nex-Gen system producers to hold out so they could create a whole new line of headsets to sell us, why not? Everyone loves money. This is why a simple problem such as blue tooth couldn't be setup from the start of 2013 when Ps4 and Xbox one were being created and tested, they set it up to change the connection codes so your device won't connect nor show up.-Having to buy a new headset such as this one in the 1st place.-No pre-sets on this one, and cannot be connected to a computer (PC) to be upgraded.-Less wireless range then the others (Which may not be a bad thing since i don't want to get brain cancer).-Brackets will most likely break just after your warrnty is up lol.There is a lot more wrong with it but can't cover it all Lol, hope this has helped and maybe you might want to go with a different company if i were you like Triton, I have been hearing good things about em i might also.---------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE!Recently the price has dropped insanely, i bought mine at 159.00$ plus shipping, now i see they are around 100 - 115$, I bought these not 2 long ago, but amazon lies about how if the price changes they will give you the difference or something, idk what ever they are talking about. I can understand if its been like many months because items drop in price its a standard thing, but i don't think i got mine but 2 months ago at most, i should return them because i don't even need them now.New fact about older headsets, if you did not know it, you can use the older headsets for PS4 now, so don't buy this at all its just crap, there is no instructions in the paperwork that comes with this headset that explain what eat beep means, so what does 2 beeps mean, or 3,4,1 ? wtf!? i have no clue!!! Now they drop the price, this is because no one is clearly buying them, their plan failed, i may send mine back, these are trash. For god's sake and your own don't buy these.Any Turtle Beach headset such as P11's PX5, PX51, PX500 Ect... will work using the correct wire connect from the headset to the controller, if you don't believe me look it up on youtube.Post Script: I don't even use this headset any longer, i just hook up my PX51's i got a year ago to my controller and im golden lawlz, we got screwed by turtle beach up the as*.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Px4 Another reason to make money off us!", "unixReviewTime": 1393545600, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2014"}

The sound is much more rich and powerful than the built in speakers, and the sound bar looks really cool.  Unfortunately, if you are looking to replace a 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound system with this, you will be sorely disappointed.First off, it isn't &#34;surround sound.&#34;  All the speakers are in the front.  Calling this &#34;surround sound&#34; is like saying the defensive linemen &#34;surrounded the quarterback&#34; at the line of scrimmage.  It just isn't possible.  It doesn't even sound like simulated surround sound.  It just sounds like a pair of stereo speakers.  I wouldn't mind so much if they had at least included outputs for your rear channel speakers.  Unfortunately, the only output is for an external subwoofer.Second, while the sound is an improvement over the built in speakers in the TV, it is not even close to the sound quality from an actual surround sound system.  The sound is much higher pitched and flatter than the surround sound receiver (I tested them side by side).  The internal subwoofers are weak enough so as to not really be noticeable when playing a movie.  When I connected my external subwoofer, it was much better.The third issue comes from controlling the sound bar.  My surround sound system uses Sony Bravia Sync (HDMI control) to run everything.  This sound bar only connects to the optical audio output from the TV.  As a result, it has to be programmed to respond to your TV remote.  The procedure to program the sound bar isn't very complicated, but it fails most of the time.  You have to program the mute, then volume down, then volume up, then power on.  If you don't do all four, and in the right order, it won't work.  If volume up fails to program, you have to clear them all and start again.  To make matters worse, it would not learn properly from the DirecTV remote that is programmed to work with the TV.  I  had to use the original remote from the TV to program it.  (When using the DirecTV remote, it learned that mute, volume up, and volume down were all &#34;mute.&#34;)  OK, so I finally got it programmed and working, after 30 minutes of doing it over and over.  It was responding to the remote perfectly, even the DirecTV remote.  About an hour later, we lost power for nearly an hour.  When the power came back on, the sound bar would no longer respond to the TV remote nor the DirecTV remote.  I had to program it all over again.  Needless to say, at this point, I re-connected my original Sony 5.1 surround receiver and set this up in my kids' bedroom with their TV.  (It does wall-mount very nicely.)In summary, it sounds better than the internal speakers in a flat-screen TV, but nowhere near as good as a real surround sound system.  It isn't a surround sound system anyway.  The remote learning function is really bad, and it loses what it learned if the power goes out.  I'd only recommend this if you cannot set up a proper surround system in your room and you have a lot of patience to program it to learn your remote.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sounds Better than the TV's Built In Speakers", "unixReviewTime": 1388966400, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2014"}

I've always found it to be a very good program for detecting things, a bit heavy on the resources, and a bit twitchy on the system.  The version i have is the same as the one listed, however it's a free upgrade from the previous version to run out the remainder of my license.  If you want the short version, I've already purchased Bitdefender Total Security to use once this runs out, so it's safe to say I recommend with minor reservations.They did seem to listen to customers with this new version.  Gone is the \"You don't need scheduled scans.\" stance they took and it's replaced with an ability and recommendation to run them.  First thing, people like to see it running so as a marketing gimmick it's probably a good idea even if it's not strictly speaking required.  Second, given the software may be disabled at certain times, it probably is a good fail safe to do a run from time to time.  Nice to see that back.  It also doesn't seem to be quite the performance hit that it once was, though to be fair the only computers I'm running it on are an i5 laptop and an i7 desktop, which both have quite a bit of RAM so I can't say how it will run on a low end system.  Given past versions, not well.You can run in either Autopilot mode or user mode.  I personally like the latter because the former will ignore any custom settings you make and I like to do a fair amount of tweaking.  Compared to some other programs, you can't tweak a lot, but you can do things like make it ask instead of automatically scanning all removable media.  I usually disable the vulnerability scans since I run Windows Update often myself anyway.  One nice feature, it will do very limited credit monitoring for you for free.  They're not exactly doing it to be nice, the trick is it will give you a scary warning \"Something has changed!\", but you have to pay to figure out what.  Last time I saw it, it was that I'd opened a store credit card.Otherwise, some of the same old problems remain.  Expect to have to do a \"repair install\" (uninstall the program as normal and it's a choice) to restore it to working condition every few months.  It's not a huge deal as it recalls the programs you set up to automatically go to Game Mode (closest you can go to disabling the resident protection), but it will lose any settings you have in the secure browser.  Oh and that brings me to my major complaints, the secure browser is incompatible with Acronis True Image that manages my system backups.  Guess which program wins out?  So yeah, useless to me when it worked find in the last Bitdefender.  The other truly awful thing is the new Wallet.  It's intrusive password manager and you can't turn it off without disabling startup items in your registry (msconfig) as well as disabling in program.  Really, my biggest turnoff.Update 05-16-14---------------I found out a very important piece of information.  If you try to do a SystemRestore (not a reformat/refresh) in Windows 8 (Windows 8.1) while Bitdefender is installed it'll very likely perpetually fail.  If you uninstall Bitdefender, Windows System Restore should work.  However, once you successfully restored your PC, Bitdefender will probably be 1/2 way installed and not work.  I can't post a URL here, but if you go to their base website and just add /uninstall at the end of the address you should get to their uninstall tools.  Download one of those and it'll clean up the mess.  Then you'll have to reinstall the antivirus from scratch which is annoying, but at least there's a workaround.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Mostly Good But Can Be Twitchy", "unixReviewTime": 1398038400, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2014"}

For $12 bucks you get a very decent hard case (with soft feel) for your valuable MacBook Air. You'll see some reviews about them not fitting properly. I bought two, Clear/White and Black Both fit just fine, but I did have to &#34;fit&#34; my white one (SEE BELOW). They also have a small cut out so as NOT to block the second mic on the left side of the new generation MacBook Air's. NICE TOUCH MOSISO.Now on the fit: You do need to make sure you have it on just right. The directions are good, but use you common sense and don't force it.  The Clear/White one seemed to fit OK and stayed on just fine, but I noticed the bottom wasn't fitting exactly right. There are small tabs on the side that come up and just barely clip to secure BOTH sides. I had to pick which one would clip since both wouldn't. Naturally I chose the left side so the 2nd mic wasn't blocked. BUT I FOUND AN EASY FIX. I've worked with various plastics before. The expand and contract pretty well and when cold hold their shape perfectly. Charging & using the Air didn't create much heat, but CAREFULLY using a hair dryer with the MacBook Air bottom up on a towel, I heated up the bottom plastic (on the machine) slowly all over.

I got these for my sister because she needed a pair of headphones for music production with a passable microphone built in. Since I&#8217;m not really the target consumer for this sort of thing, I just wanted to explain this before getting into the review. I do have a great deal of experience with a wide range of headphones from mid-grade options like the Corsair to very expensive Sennheisers and everything in between. Thus, this review will mostly pertain to sound quality.First, the design is nice. It&#8217;s a closed back design, which eliminates a lot of ambient sound. The ear pieces are huge and will fully enclose your ears, provided you&#8217;re not a giant. The microfiber memory foam ear pads are very, very comfortable. A lot of headphones sound great, but they&#8217;re uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time, but the Corsairs will not fatigue you. I have two pairs of AKG headphones and while they sound amazing, they are not at all comfortable for long listening sessions. Not so with the Corsairs.The sound is surprisingly good. I didn&#8217;t have high expectations for these, but I was very pleasantly surprised. With cheaper headphones that aren&#8217;t necessarily aimed at a discerning audiophile type listener, you tend to find artificially bright treble and overly heavy bass. The Corsairs were more neutral that I would have expected. They actually had a nice midrange and a good overall sound. Perhaps they are a bit heavier in the bass than something totally neutral, but I think some slight bass emphasis is what a lot of people want these days, so maybe it&#8217;s not a bad thing for everyone.The Corsairs are a 32 ohm design, which means that you can power them adequately with a low voltage device like an iPod or a iPhone or a laptop without needing an external headphone amp. These will play plenty loud off of most any portable device, and they&#8217;ll even give you good bass response to boot.Overall, I must say I&#8217;m impressed. You can find better headphones in this price range if all you&#8217;re looking for is music, but if you can use the builtin mic, these are a nice crossover pair that will work for gaming and for music.

I have messed around with the settings but sadly the entire thing just didn't want to work correctly. I have dismissed the issues for a while because it was running decently, but i really should have returned it day 1 of my problems.This model has beam forming which should connect to mobile devices and such to increase signal strength. This does indeed work and i was pleased with this function, as my mobile wi-fi increased SLIGHTLY. I was just hyped up for this product and dismissed all of the problems and everything else that went wrong / worked only 1/2 as advertised.The bandwidth advertised does its job somewhat well, and it can keep quite a fiew devices working. Problem is that the packet management for this is TERRIBLE. I found that enabling any of the multimedia / QoS settings, set up with all the correct ports as high priority traffic MADE THE POCKET CLOTTING WORSE THAN BEFORE!One of the other things this is supposed to do is to allow multimedia to come through faster. This is over exaggerated on this product once you turn the multimedia feature on.

Even audio from your smart device could be accessed and streamed to the receiver via AirPlay. There's built-in internet radio and Pandora/Spotify as well as support for lossless formats such as FLAC and WAV.

Rear speaker connections are all binding posts and there are 5 pairs. The receiver is able to be set for bi-amplification of the front channels if you don't have surround sound speakers attached which is very nice. There is HDMI audio pass through so the unit doesn't have to be on if you just want sound from your TV's speakers.

They send a clear but not unfriendly message to neighbors that I'm not looking for conversation.3.  Therefore, they allow me to hear--and hence enjoy--the music, movie, or book that I'm listening to, or to nap in relative peace and quiet if I want to.These headphones are heads and shoulders better than my comparably priced earbuds, which (1) did not block noise nearly as well; (2) were not as obvious to neighbors seeking conversation; and (3) did not produce sound as clear or beautiful as these (after a few hours of break-in).Finally, while I'm sure that active noise-canceling headphones would do an even better job of canceling ambient noise, don't underestimate the convenience--especially in the cramped quarters of economy class--of not having wires that tangle, clutter, and get yanked out when you're shifting around in your seat.

It isn't practical to always leave the TV on so you can remotely access the device or reboot it every time you turn your TV on.

The native search functions within the help page are pretty good.But the really, really, really frustrating thing is the full-page apps.  Since this is a desktop operating system, you should be able to toggle between operating in full-page to operating the app within a window in a traditional desktop.  Not being able to toggle betwene full-page mode and traditional windows mode greatly diminishes functionality compared to everything being a normal window (which, of course, can be expanded to full-screen mode anyway).I'm not sure what Microsoft was thinking with this.  When I use a browser, I often want to open other programs - i.e. using the browser to look up something about the app I am using.  If I use one of these full-page apps, I feel like I am crippled, and on Windows 8, there are MANY MANY apps that only operate in full-page mode.That said, I have NO PROBLEM with a Start Page instead of a Start Menu.  I have no problem with tiles vice icons, which is what most people complain about.  Maybe because I use a Trackball instead of a traditional mouse (Trackballs are ergonomically much more efficient than traditional mice), I find it quite pleasurable to use tile mode, and that it's just as easy as using the traditional icon and menu-based interface of older Windows versions.But having apps - especially system apps - that only operate in full-screen mode is NOT OK.

I may not be in the &#34;target audience&#34;, meaning I don't use this as a baby monitor, kid tracker, or neighbor watcher.

You can attach a micro SD like the ones used on cell phones and tablet to add storage.Cons1. Expensive. At $899 for 64 GB it should have at least included the keyboard.2. The screen size is considerably smaller than the average laptop.3. The windows app store is very limited.4. Can get pretty hot if using heavy programs.5. There is no safe place to secure the pen.6. Only has a single USB port.I am writing this review to give an objective look at what has turned out to be a very polarizing product. Don't let the long list of cons at the top fool you into thinking I don't like the laptop. I like it, I like it a lot. I have been using this laptop for a few weeks now and I am still impressed at how useful and powerful it is. I will be discussing each of my pros and cons with more details below.Pros (Continuation)1. When I first laid hands on the laptop I did not have the type cover keyboard that I use now. Instead I had to rely on using it solely as a tablet for the first couple of weeks. If you have ever used an Ipad or an Android tablet this computer will blow all of them out of the water when it comes to performance. It is much faster than any tablet that I used before. It doesn't lag like Android tablets and it is much more versatile than an Ipad. I have the 64 GB model that comes with 4 GB of built in memory. As of right now this has been more than enough for me. At times I had between 6-8 programs running in the background with a dozen tabs opened on Internet Explorer. The computer has not flinched once. It is very smooth. I have absolutely no complaints when it comes to performance. I have been using it in \"balanced mode\" and not on \"high performance\" because I rather conserve battery life when I am using it. It has not mattered, this thing is a workhorse.2. The second biggest advantage this laptop has is how light and pocket able it is. This laptop weights about 2 pounds without the keyboard. The keyboard weight maybe about another half pound. At 2 and a half pounds (roughly) this is one of the lightest laptops you can find on the market right now. When you stop using the laptop the keyboard can be folded up like a book or it can be simply taken away completely. Being able to take away the keyboard at any time is one of the biggest advantages that this laptop has over the other 2 in 1 laptops I seen on the market. Most of the other ones you can rotate the screen 360 degrees and fold the screen over the keyboard and it acts like a tablet. The problem with that is that you are still carrying the entire weight and the bulk of the keyboard with you everywhere. That is very uncomfortable when you are trying to use it as a tablet. The Microsoft Surface on the other hand is only about three quarters of an inch thick without the keyboard and about an inch thick with the keyboard. Like I said before, very pocket able.3. The construction of the tablet is made out of metal, not plastic. It feels pretty tough and solid on the hands. Probably the biggest weakness is the actual screen itself which at the end of the day is made out of glass. I have seen videos where it can easily withstand drops on its sides and on its back with very minimal damage on the tablet. When it is dropped face down however, it has cracked just like a cell phone screen would crack.4. When it comes to battery life Microsoft did a pretty good job improving from the first generation Surface laptop. On a regular day the laptop lasts about 6 hours. I mainly use it indoors with the screen on at a quarter brightness. It is definitely comfortable to see indoors and it makes for a good balance between battery life and visibility. If you use the laptop for games or heavy programs like Photoshop then the battery life is going to go down considerably however. What happens is that a few minutes after you start playing a graphic intensive game the fan on the inside turns on and that uses quite a bit of battery. But if you are looking to browse the web or programs like Microsoft Office then I don't think you will have any problems getting at least 6 hours on it. I have seen reviews where they claim they have gotten 7 hours but I think that they are pushing it.5. I am currently in college. I use the pen that comes with the Surface every single day. It is an excellent tool for note taking. I carry all of my notes for all my classes on the computer. All of my notes are hand written because I love making sketches and annotation when I am taking notes. I also have all my books in pdf documents and I love being able to make annotation on them. The program used to make take notes is called One Note and comes with Microsoft Office. One Note has a slightly higher learning curve that the S-Note applications found on the Samsung Note series. But it is nothing major, it is worth it to take the time to learn how to use it. It is an excellent program and it is essential if you want to make the most of the pen that comes bundled with the Surface.6. The $899 model of the laptop only comes with 64 GB SDD for storage. Only 36 GB of those are usable right out of the box. The rest is taken up by the Operating System. Thankfully, Microsoft decided to include a Micro SD slot on the side of the laptop that allows you to insert a Micro SD Card just like the ones found on cell phones and other tablets. You can buy a 32 GB card for about $20 dollars.Cons (Continuation)1. The single biggest problem I had with this tablet when I was deciding on buying it was the price. At $899 for only 64 GB of hard drive it is very expensive. Keep in mind that the keyboard is not included. The keyboard will set you back another $130 dollars. It is beyond me why Microsoft does not include the keyboard with the laptop. They call the keyboard an accessory but honestly it is a necessity. You can't really do any real work on the laptop without the physical keyboard. The on screen keyboard that appears when you don't have the physical keyboard attached makes it very painful to use when you are trying to use the laptop on desktop mode. Anyways, if you are looking at the Surface simply as a laptop and not as a combination of a laptop and tablet then keep in mind you can probably get a better deal buying a regular laptop. You can get an i5 processor laptop with 4GB of ram and about 300 GB HDD for around $500 dollars. The Surface makes more financial sense for those people that plan to use the computer both as a laptop and a tablet. Why spend $500 dollars on a tablet and another $500 dollars on a laptop when you can have both in one product that you can carry around at all times?2. The drawback of making such a light and portable laptop is that the screen size is considerably smaller than the average laptop. The screen size is 10.6 inches diagonally which is closer to a tablet than a laptop. I personally do not have a problem with that but I know a lot of other people do. Many people are used to working with 15-17 inch laptops. When they see the size of the Surface they simply can't handle it. I have not encountered any problems with the size when working with it myself but I can see how this small size might not be ideal for somebody who is working on graphic design or AutoCad. Sometimes you just need more real estate to work with.3. The Windows app store is still severely inferior to the Android and IOS App store. There are many apps that I have found on the Android Play Store that are missing on the Windows Store. However, this is not nearly as big of a problem in the Surface Pro 2 because you still can install all the regular programs that a normal laptop can install. The Windows app store is constantly improving but they still have work to do when it comes to creating apps that will work well with a device that has such a small screen.4. Due to the limited size of the laptop it tends to get hot when under a lot of stress. This laptop will get quite warm when you are using heavy games and graphic intensive programs. It is not that big deal of a deal if you are using it in your lap or on table. I purchased a cover for the computer that protected the outer covering of the laptop but it was badly designed. I saw that it covered a large portion of the of the air vent that keeps the computer cool. The computer CPU got quite hot after using it only for a few minutes. Be careful, what kind of cover you buy for this laptop.5. It is a shame that Microsoft did not include a safe way to store the pen. They have it so you can attach the pen to the side of the laptop. But the magnet is not very strong and it is very easily to drop the pen by mistake. I always have to carry the pen on a side compartment of my book bag. They should have done what Samsung did with the Note series where you can store the pen inside the device itself. I was disappointed. I know myself, I know at some point I am going to lose the pen and end up paying $30 dollars for a replacement.6. Another limitation that the laptop has is the fact that it only has one USB slot. That can be a problem if you are planning to use more than one USB accessory. I don't like to use the trackpad on the type cover keyboard as a mouse. While I am at home I always use a Bluetooth mouse. I had to buy it separately because I did not want my other regular wireless mouse to occupy my only USB port with the receiver. Keep in mind that the charger that comes with the computer also comes with a USB port that can be used to charge your cell phone if you desire. That one can only be used for charging purposes though.In conclusion, I want to say I highly recommend this laptop/tablet if you are a student or are looking to give a gift to a college bound student. It is much better decision than buying an Ipad if you are looking to get real work done. Just know that there are going to be limitations such as screen size and price. I love my laptop and I really hope that this review has helped you decide whether it is right for you or not.

Let me give some context about myself. I spend a lot of time listening to music while I work as a computer programmer, so I have an excellent setup at my desk: ABurson Conductor SL 1793amp andBeyerdynamic T5pheadphones. I'm not the most hardcore audiophile in the world (I happily stream my music from Spotify at 320 kbps), but I definitely appreciate good audio quality up to a point.I compared this amp to the Burson and to the cheaper portableFIIO E17. Not surprisingly, the sound quality of the PHA-2 was somewhere in between the two, as its pricetag suggests. Specifically, I found it to be slightly better than the FIIO, but lackluster compared to the Burson. That's an unfair comparison--the Burson costs twice as much and is non-portable--but useful as a benchmark of what a great headphone amp can do. The Burson has a quality to it that makes you want to dance, largely because bass sounds are richly defined: it's like the drummer is right in front of you. Those same sounds feel relatively muddy from the PHA-2. Again, this isn't surprising for an amp in this form factor and price point, but it raises the question of who needs this amp.If you're looking for the absolute best sound and money is no object, the PHA-2 isn't the answer. Go look on Head-Fi and you'll find no shortage of similar devices with glowing reviews. If you're looking to get better sound from mass-market headphones and you want something you can toss in a bag, get the FIIO E17. I don't find anything about the PHA-2 compelling enough to justify the premium. In principle, I like the solid build (it feels like it could survive a longer drop than the FIIO, to be sure) and the analog controls, but in practice those features are also cumbersome: the volume knob is partly blocked by one of the protective \"arms,\" making it slightly clumsy to turn and making it impossible to see the volume level at a glance when it's turned to certain angles. And as many other reviewers have mentioned, you can't charge its battery while using it, a limitation the FIIO doesn't have.I don't want this review to seem too negative: If this were a $200 unit, I'd happily give it 5 stars.

You accept some reduced functionality for the idea that you'll need less hardware and thus get a cheaper computer.  Too often the sacrifices manufacturers make (e.g. HP Chromebook 11) lead to a bad product.  Either the processor is bad (Samsung Chromebook, HP Chromebook 11), the ram is too little (Toshiba Chromebook), or they're asking too high a cost (Chromebook Pixel).  Somehow Acer managed to hit the sweet spot of compromise with the C720 and keep it cheap.In all honesty, spec wise, it's insane this only costs $250 when HP is charging more for less.  While the HP Chromebook is better built and has a better screen the device's insides are too slow and old to make doing anything more than 3 tabs open a slow crawl.  The C720 can handle most anything you throw at it, keep as many tabs open as you'd like, watch HD video - you'll get that all and impressive battery life, over 8 hours.This device isn't perfect, the keyboard and trackpad could be better.  The screen bezel is a bit too large and glossy.  But honestly it doesn't matter when you factor in value and performance.  So long as you know what you're getting in to with Chrome OS this is the best chromebook to buy, save maybe the touch version of this (not the one with only 2GB but the one with 4GB still).

The GiG is relatively small, measuring 2.1 x 7 x 3.6 inches, and weighs 1.5 pounds. You also notice that the Gig is solid and feels like it is built to last. The wraparound band also makes the GiG very portable; the band, which is replaceable, acts as a carrying handle and also as a stand.The sound the GiG produces, however, is anything but small. Klipsch has a long history of making good audio equipment. The GiG upholds that reputation well. Its dual 1&#8221; drivers balanced with dual 2&#8221; passive radiators create a very full sound, with very strong bass and dynamic clear and crisp highs. At its peak the GiG produces 20 watts of sound.I tested the GiG with iOS and Android devices, and each time the device paired easily with the speaker. If you have a newer Android device, you can also connect with the GiG via NFC. The GiG gets very loud regardless of device, but I did notice that the speaker gets extra loud when paired with an Android MP3 player I own, to the point where music with extra bass would distort at  high volume.Bass is particularly strong. While not overwhelming at regular volume, you will definitely notice the bass, and, if you like a good dose of the low end with your music, you will like this speaker. Good bass response helps some music (such as classical) but may distort bass heavy music, such as hip-hop or techno music.Klipsch clearly put some thought behind the controls. The power button is at the top or side (depending on if the speaker is vertical or sitting horizontal) and the volume button also allows you to pause or play tracks, skip tracks forward and backward, and the very top of the button has a battery life indicator. The battery is rated for 12 hours, and the speaker comes with two travel bags and international power adapters for AC operation.There is much to like and recommend about the Klipsch. While it will not fit into your pocket, the speaker is very portable and appears to be very durable, so the speaker will travel well.  Klipsch clearly put some thought and effort into the design and provides nice extras, such as a travel bag for the international adapters.The speaker's bass response, as well as its design and look and feel, are the GiG's biggest strengths. It is not inexpensive, falling in the same price range as the popular and highly-rated Ultimate Ears Boom and Bose Mini SoundLink speakers. I like the fact that the GiG gets very loud, and the sound it produces easily fills a room. I also like the extra strong bass response and the full range of sound it produces.

The sound isolation is very nice when properly fitted, offering you the ability to hear loud noises from the outside, but generally keeping your music where you want it, in your ears.Build quality, for headphones of this price, is very good. They are not quite as nice as the Brainwavz S1 earbuds I have, but the price on those is about 3 times what these are. If you need the ability to have a microphone for your phone, you won't want the Deltas - I would highly, very highly, recommend the Brainwavz S1 earbuds for that use.Bass is a little light out of the box, but this is easy to correct with equalization. Using JRiver Media Center you can build out the EQ to your preference, which is what I did with these. After boosting the bass by about 6 dB (low end frequencies), the tinny sound at loud volumes has been corrected easily and the sound from these is quite nice. It isn't at the level of say, my Sennheiser HD598s, but those are a different pair of headphones for a different purpose. For traveling, I will take either the S1s or these, no question.Overall the audio quality is very good. Other than being a little bass light out of the box, I would say audio quality is much better than other headphones I've used at this price range previously. I've pushed the EQ across the board, and as expected there is a lot of distortion pushing these that far (every headphone does this). The thing is, it took roughly 6-8 dB to make any one frequency start to color the sound with distortion, which is quite a good thing.

Meanwhile, the \"fix\" drains energy efficiency by keeping the screen at its brightest, so after the fix, one should not expect to get nearly the battery life touted.2) SLEEP.  Computer would not wake up from sleep.  After spending almost an entire day troubleshooting and talking with three different support people at Lenovo, the third person recommended turning off a setting which finally appears to have fixed the problem.3) WIFI.  Y2P drops WIFI signal frequently.  Another Ultrabook I tested with the same WIFI card also dropped frequently.  Meanwhile, a $400 Lenovo with a different WIFI card almost never drops.  I have verified that the problem is not with the network equipment and have seen other users complain about this problem online.4) DISPLAY.  While the display produces awesome resolution, some screens or parts of screens load with super-tiny print and images--too tiny to be able to read or to select options (because option boxes are too tiny).  Unfortunately, I have read that software developers haven't caught up with this kind of display.  The options to make displayed items larger (large icons, increased font size, CTRL + (plus key), etc.) don't increase the size of everything.  So some things will just be micro-tiny no matter what.  Also, all these attempts to increase the size of items on the screen at times results in some gawky screens due to larger fonts and icons mixed with disproportionately smaller ones.  Other users have complained about this in online forums.5) BATTERY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY.  With various fixes in place, energy efficiency and battery life won't be as advertised.  I might get 3-4 hours out of my brand new computer battery without a charge if I am conservative.  In addition to the \"fix\" discussed in number one above, the computer also has an auto-brightness feature, which I assume was intended to save energy, but which causes the screen to constantly get brighter, then dimmer--causing it to flicker--so that feature must also be turned off.Before I decide if I will return it or not, I am going to contact Lenovo one last time.  I like the computer and think that without these problems, it would be an awesome computer.  I tested and returned another Ultrabook before this because it also had many problems.  If you buy any Ultrabook at this time, just know that you may have to spend a chunk of time troubleshooting and fixing your brand new computer--something that never happened to me until I got an Ultrabook.UPDATE: Out of the first five calls, I have three times gotten connected with support reps not sufficiently knowledgeable about the issue.  (And the sixth callee wouldn't help without a fee.)  They seemed to be reading from a script and frequently simply wanted to reset the computer back to factory settings.  After this is done, one must re-enter settings, re-install software and re-load data.  I did the reset one time, but not after that.  It turns out the reset was not the fix.  For item four, I was told to report this to \"Software Support\"--a separate call.  Software support--in  problem call number 6--reviewed the matter and said that to solve the problem, I'd first have to buy an extended warranty or pay a one-time $59 fee for them to fix it.  Keep in mind that in addition to this being a new computer delivered in this condition, the first 3 out of 5 Lenovo calls I made didn't solve other issues.  The tech sounded like a trainee (had someone else helping him) and said they knew what the problem was and that I needed to change a font setting, but would not tell me what the setting was without paying a fee.  As many other users have complained about this same issue, I wasn't certain he really knew if the answer or not.  A retail computer tech looked at it and thought it was a bug.  Lenovo claimed it was a setting that needs to be changed, but wouldn't tell me what it was.  The fact that it came this way and they want a user to pay to fix it seems dishonest.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "WEAK SUPPORT CAUSED DOWNGRADED REVIEW--GREAT IDEA THAT WAS DELIVERED WITH PROBLEMS", "unixReviewTime": 1392422400, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2014"}

If needed I can have an external HDD, a printer and the video card all on the same USB and everything is still working fast enough.If I have any video problems they will be with the micro HDMI, which will not initialize, I will have to put the laptop to sleep mode and then try again, usually it will work after that.if the laptop goes to sleep it will leave the monitor that is connected through the USB3 on, it will not go to sleep mode automatically.Battery is not removable, which is sad if you have the laptop on power all the time except when you travel like I do. on my old Toshiba I would just remove the battery so I don't have the yo-yo effect.Touch screen is fun, not usable for serious work though.Sound is very good, very surprised by it.Camera is great! 720p!Keyboard is great, love it.Size is also great.

I recently upgraded to the Hero 3+ Black Edition and wanted the same functionality so I also bought the battery bacpac for it.  But there are some differences between the two designs which reduce the functionality in the 3+ version as well as a &#34;hardware issue&#34; (per several e-mails with GoPro) which renders it counter-productive in some uses.  More on these in a moment but on top of it all, I found out the battery backpac for the HD Hero, which I already owned, works fine with the 3+ without any of the other problems or issues.  It would have been nice for GoPro to make it known that if you already have the HD bacpac version, you don't need the 3+ bacpac version, unless you need the minor weight savings or increased power (but at least it works!).Reduced functionality.  The HD Hero bacpac had a removable battery.  This allowed the battery to be swapped out with a fresh one without going through a recharging process on the spot.  It also allowed the backpack to be used to charge extra batteries when it was not attached to the camera.  The 3+ bacpac is one piece, the battery is built-in so it can not be replaced with a fresh one unless you have another whole battery bacpac.  Neither can the 3+ bacpac be used to charge other GoPro batteries.Hardware Issue.  This to me is the killer.  I found out through use (no advance notice of this by GoPro) that with the 3+ bacpac attached, when the bacpac battery is depleted, it automatically turns the camera on.  This might seem to be a useful and necessary function.  Now, it is if the camera is filming when the bacpac dies &#8211; you want the camera to keep running.  But, because all batteries lose power over time even when they are not in active use, when the bacpac battery is discharged, it will turn the camera on.  If the camera is set to turn off after a specified period of inactivity, it will indeed turn off.  But in a few seconds it will turn itself back on.  Even if you manually turn the camera off, it turns back on.  It will keep doing so until the camera battery is also completely discharged even if no recording has taken place, like if it was packed in your luggage or backpack or kayak or whatever.  You go to use it and both batteries are completely dead.  Having purchased an extra battery to provide longer recording times, you end up with only using part of one battery anyway.  GoPro&#8217;s &#8220;solution&#8221; to me on this admitted hardware issue was to remove the bacpac when it was depleted and just use the camera.  This not only defeats the purpose of the bacpac &#8211; you could more easily replace the camera battery with an extra that is also cheaper than the bacpac &#8211; but it also involves changing the back of the camera case.  None of this is advisable when you are using the GoPro underwater, in wet or unstable environments like kayaking or climbing, or just about any other condition GoPros were designed for.These things should be recalled with apologies and full refunds to everyone who bought one.  For many uses they are counter-productive.  If you already have a previous version, it is better, use it instead.

The ES-CTI300 is tailored for use with mobile devices, specifically Apple iPhones, iPods, iPads, etc.  And it serves that function very well.PROS:- Great overall sound quality- Good, but not extreme bass response- Detachable cord- Good looks- Good cord length for mobile useCONS:- Lacks extras- Slightly uncomfortable at firstCOMFORTI found the Onkyo slightly uncomfortable at first, but after a few weeks, they stretched out a bit and I got used to them.  The leatherette earpads and cushioned headband are soft and cushy, but were a little tight on my average-sized head.  I can wear them for about an hour at a time now, before needing a break.  I was a little disappointed that Onkyo didn't include a set of replacement pads.SOUND QUALITYI liked the overall sound quality of the Onkyo.  It had good detail and the low end was sufficiently represented in modern music.  I listened to some Macklemore, Daft Punk, Pitbull, and Ke$ha to test out the bass.  Some headphones just put out way too much lousy bass and ruin the track.  The Onkyo, I felt had a nice balance.  I also enjoyed listening to old rock bands like AC/DC, Van Halen, Queen, and Rush.DESIGNThe closed, on-ear headphones do a fairly good job of not leaking noise, so they're perfect for use at work or for studying.  The tangle-resistant cord is the perfect length for mobile use.  At just under 4 feet, you can keep your iPhone or iPod in your pocket or backpack.  Make no mistake, this is not meant for your home stereo.  Though they're detachable, the cords are actually quite difficult to detach and better left connected to reduce possible strain from attaching and detaching them.  The Control Talk remote works well with Apple devices.  One last thing I want to mention is that the 3.5mm plug works with some iPhone cases, but not others.  I had a Sector 5 Black Ops Element Case on my iPhone 5s and the plug would not sit flush enough to work.  Using my Speck Products Candyshell Grip case, however, the plug fit perfectly.  I had no problems with my MacBook or iPad (with Speck FitFolio case).MISCA carrying case is included with the headphones, but it's one of the cheapest little bags I've seen for a $200 pair of headphones.  You might be better off using a nice shoe bag.  An extra set of cables and earpads would've been a nice touch, but those aren't included either.CONCLUSIONThe Onkyo ES-CTI300 has a nicely balanced sound.  I was strictly an accuracy sound guy before, writing off any product that deviated from a flat sound signature.  Headphones like the Onkyo ES-CTI300 and the Logitech UE 6000 have made me change my mind.  These headphones do a good job of keeping the details of a song, while also responding to the sound of modern music.  Considering the lack of quality extras, I feel like the Onkyo is slightly overpriced, but I would have no problems recommending them to music lovers of all ages, across all genres.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Terrific sound and ideal for use with mobile devices", "unixReviewTime": 1393027200, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2014"}

The work-around to the problem is as follows: Configure the Video Station app so that your videos are indexed as \"Home Movies\" instead of indexing them as \"Movies\" or \"TV Shows\". The indexing features for Home Movies don't attempt to perform internet searches for the metadata content, so there will be no mistakes in the video tagging.There is only one down side to this which is when you play the movies, in the player app, they appear under the \"home movies\" heading instead of the \"movies\" heading. This is not a major problem.So my primary complaint about this product is resolved. Upping review from one star to four stars. The fifth star shall remain in reserve for the day where no work-arounds are needed at all. :-)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is the old review, so that you can understand the nature of the problem that required the work-around:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The reason that you might want to buy a Synology DS214play in particular, is because it's the first device in the Synology NAS line which has 1080p GPU hardware transcoding built in. What this means is, if you want it to stream a video to another device (say, to a Chromecast, or to your tablet device), and the video format isn't directly supported, then you want the DS214play to convert that video to a format that your device CAN play. Doing this in high quality for high resolution videos is a tall order, but with the transcoding chip in the DS214play this becomes possible. I have tested this and it works great, I was able to Chromecast a high definition 1080p video of a concert that I had performed in. The video had been saved in a format that was not originally directly Chromecast compatible. The video played perfectly in 1080p thanks to the hardware transcoding on this box.BUT... In order for this feature to work, at the time of this writing, you needed to use Synology's own \"Video Station\" app for this to work. Because the popular and common third party \"Plex\" app can't (yet) take advantage of the hardware transcoder in the DS214play. Plex recently dropped hints on their forums that this might be in the works, but it's not here yet. I like Plex and I want to be able to use it, but without the hardware transcoding, it's academic for me at this point. So for now, you're stuck using Synology's own \"Video Station\" app for this instead.Although Synology's Video Station isn't strictly \"built in\" to the product (you have to download it like any other app), it's about as close to built-in as you can get. It's in the first page of \"recommended\" apps in the Synology Package Center, and it's essentially the default video sharing app on this thing. As far as I'm concerned, this, combined with the fact that it's the only app that can take advantage of the 214play's hardware transcoding, makes it a \"built in\" app for the purposes of this review. It's really your only choice.So what happens when you use Synology's Video Station app? For every video that you copy to the NAS's hard disk, it automatically searches for the video file's name on the internet and fills in the data for the closest match. It fills in the name of the video, fills in the video box art, the actors, directors, plot synopsis, everything. This box art and information is what you see when you are browsing the library for videos, either using the web interface or your mobile device. All of it filled in automatically.It does a terrible job at this, of course.I uploaded a test of several dozen random video files onto this thing. Among other mistakes, here are a couple of examples of the mistakes it made on my system:- A music video for Alex Lifeson's song \"promise\" was incorrectly tagged with the synopsis and box art of a Finnish WW2 Drama film called Promise. Never mind that the drama film was 2 hours long and the music video was only five minutes. Apparently their metadata search doesn't take length into account.- The Carl Sagan \"Cosmos\" episode, \"The Lives of Stars\", was incorrectly tagged with the synopsis and box art of a documentary about porn stars called \"The Secret Lives of Adult Stars\". Several other Cosmos episodes were mis-tagged, but that was the worst one.In total, out of several dozen files:- The number of bad/false metadata tags applied was approximately 10-15 files.- Out of those, the number of bad/false metadata tags that incorrectly showed innocent videos as adult, porn, or tangentially porn-related: approximately 2-3.- The number of correct metadata tags that showed up: 0.- The remainder all just had their original file names with no metadata.Then I looked at how to remove this bad metadata. There is no way to globally remove it, and, even if you go into each file one at a time, it is a difficult multi-step hard-to-find process (I couldn't find the option to edit the metadata on my own without google searching for how to do it), and, worse, you can't remove the box art without supplying it with an alternate box art yourself. (The box art only gives you the choice to supply a file, not to remove the box art altogether.) Strike one.Then I went looking for a way to turn this automatic internet-metadata-searching off. Though I might be able to edit 10-15 files now, once I actually fill this thing up with all my files (and the files of the other members of my household), I don't want to have to hand-edit hundreds of files to get rid of bad metadata. Guess what? There isn't a way to do it. I googled and FAQ'ed. There is no answer. I searched the Synology user forums. Other people on the forums have been complaining about this same thing for a long time, and there is no solution there. The others who encountered the problem, who were posting on the Synology forums, were a lot more embarrassed by the porn thing than I was, because they had kids, and it was Kid's videos that were getting mistagged as porn. Especially when they tried to show their wife how the new NAS worked. WHOOPS. Strike two.On the Synology forums, there are no repsonses from Synology employees to the people encountering the issue. There are no entries in the Synology knowledge base covering this topic. No one, anywhere, is saying that Synology is working on a solution. Every query is met with silence. Strike three.I opened a support ticket on this, using their web based support system, but it was on a Friday, and I guess they don't have weekend support. I'm not optimistic that they'll have an official solution, because I'm not the first person to complain about this, and everyone else on the Synology forums is getting the silent treatment. I see nothing to indicate that I'm going to be any different in this regard.In contrast: Using Plex is dream compared to this. Plex makes far fewer mistakes when searching for metadata. Plex got a few accurate correct metadata tags in my sample set of files, which, although not many, was still several times more correct than Video Station got. And when Plex mis-tags a file, it is a one-click operation to remove that bad data. Finally, Plex does have a configuration option which allows it to skip the automatic internet metadata searching altogether (though it's not clearly named). So yay, Plex is great, but... I can't use it on this thing because it won't take advantage of the hardware transcoding (yet).So, since I seem to be stuck with Video Station, I took it upon myself to find a solution.After two solid days of investigation and experimentation, and enlisting help from friends who are Linux experts, I have finally figured out a way to hack around this by editing files on the Synology hard disk. I literally had to locate and modify the scripts that search for the metadata, and deliberately mangle the internet addresses that the scripts used for the searching. I also had to flag the metadata-searching daemon as non-executable. I also had to fully deinstall and reinstall the Video Station app and start over from scratch before doing any of those modifications, because if I didn't, it would simply have kept the bad metadata in its database. Finally, the solution I implemented is such that, if the Video Station app gets updated, I can't take the update unless I'm willing to do the hacking all over again a second time. So I had to turn off auto-updating on Video Station.I've posted the detailed steps of my solution in the Synology Forums. Search for \"Metadata Porn\" there and you'll find it. I'm proud of the solution that my friends and I came up with, and it makes the NAS usable for me. But the fact that I had to spend two days investigating and tinkering with the thing to work at a basic baseline \"no false porn tags\" level, gives it Strike Four.I'm reviewing this product as one star, because out of the box IT. IS. NOT. USABLE.- By default, out of the box, it tags your innocent documentary and kid's video files as porn. In no one's book does this count as making it a usable product.- Synology does not have a fix for this problem at the time of this writing.- Synology didn't even test it well enough to figure out that they needed an off switch for the auto-metadata-searching. YOU CAN'T TURN OFF THE FALSE PORN TAGGING.- Synology has not repsonded to anyone on their user forums who were complaining about this problem.- To fix the problem, I had to spend two days investigating and hacking, and at the time of this writing I think I'm the only person on the planet who has solved this problem. Hopefully, soon others will be able to successfully implement my fix, but my point is they shouldn't have to fix it, it should just work OK out of the box.Synology, if you're reading this review:FIXTHISPROBLEMNOWPLEASE.If you do, I will change this review to four stars.(If you guys care about that sort of thing.) If you go the extra mile, and help Plex get hardware transcoding working, so that I can start using their excellent app instead, I will increase the review to five stars.If you're someone else reading this review, and you know how useful and powerful Synology's products can be, and you're willing to perform the hacking that I did, then by all means, ignore the 1-star review and get this thing. It's a quiet, fast, powerful NAS, the first of its kind with hardware transcoding, with a lot of great features and an amazing array of installable apps.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "If your Synology Video Station App mis-tags your videos, here is a work-around.", "unixReviewTime": 1399161600, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2014"}

I've found nothing online, been to Fry's, Radioshack and BestBuy, and it's not offered on Fiio's site.

It was barely touched), or even just furnishing a means to buy a replacement, was to provide two, so you'll have another one when the first one breaks--no thought as to what you do when the second one breaks though.I really can't believe it.

I previously owned a small Wacom Intuos Pen and Touch tablet for recreational drawing and I would say that the Huion Pro is on par in terms of quality and functionality. In fact, it is sizeably bigger than the Intuos, though cheaper to boot.The tablet does not have a touch or gesture feature like the Intuos, and neither is its surface as similar. The Intuos had a papery textured surface to make it seem as if you are actually drawing on paper, but the Huion tablet does not. The texture is plastic-y. It threw me off at first, but I became accustomed to its texture as it made strokes a lot more easier and puts less wear on the pen nibs that came with the tablet (more on the pen and nibs later).The tablet itself also has quick keys on the left for erasing, zooming in and out, scrolling, and a lot more for convenience, which can be mapped to your own preference. There is also an LED indicator for strokes that lights up with each stroke to let you know that it's working. It is very big, though not at all hefty, and beautiful in design.The tablet's package includes a USB cable which powers the tablet (no it is not wireless), a CD loaded with drivers (though I recommend downloading them straight from their website for more up-to-date drivers), a charger for the rechargeable pen, the pen itself (which features an incredibly long battery life and two quick key buttons though regrettably I do not use them so I don't actually know their function. Also the pen does NOT work on other tablets, though maybe other Huion tablets), a set of great pen nibs (5 including the one already inside the pen), and a pen rest/nib holder container. And you will get ALL OF THIS for less than $100.Though as much as I love this tablet, I cannot be biased. The tablet does, well for me, have its hiccups where the tablet won't register the difference between light or hard strokes and the quick keys won't function properly. It doesn't happen as often, though maybe it may be just my tablet specifically, but if it does happen, do not worry. You can either: 1) unplug your tablet from the PC then replug it, 2) close and exit out of your art software, in my case, Manga Studio 5, and open it back up, or if neither works, 3) uninstall the tablet and re-download new drivers from Huion's website, which is easy and painless.Overall, despite the small issues I have with it, it is a VERY solid tablet for budget artists.

I was hesitant at first by the reviews on Amazon because most 5-star reviews were from non-purchasers who got the device for free to write a review. The real buyers' reviews didn't seem to agree with them. But I decided to buy it and test it firsthand.I care a lot about aesthetics, and this device looks amazing in pictures - an indicator I relate to product quality. When I received it, I was not disappointed. I bought the champagne gold color one.The first thing to notice when I opened the box that it had a nice smooth shiny look without the cheap plastic feel at all.  Even the cables were thin to be barely visible in the car and didn't feel like clumsy plastic wires. The device itself is smaller than what it looked in pictures, and it connected firmly to the magnetic base.I rushed to me car to try it. Once I connected the charger to the lighter, the two USB ports illuminated in blue: Beautiful design! The ring and forward/backward buttons on the device illuminated in blue as well, and flashed when you turned on until it paires with the phone. I have an iPhone 4S, and it paired seamlessly with it.Then, it was downhill from that point. Once I connected the 3.5mm cable into my car's AUX port, the first thing I noticed was the constant humming noise coming from the speakers :(. I tried to fiddle with the AUX cable hoping to eliminate it at no avail. I played some music through it to see if the humming noise would disappear or fase, but you can't stop thinking that it is there. In moments of silence, you will notice it in the background. Once I turned off the device, the car went back to complete silence. I tried making a phone call with it, and it seemed to be working fine, but the humming noise was there during the whole phone call. The other party cannot hear it, only the ones in the car can. The humming noise is not because of my speakers/radio system. For example, if I connect my phone using my AUX cable directly and don't play anything, I don't hear any noise at all. And when I play music, the sound quality using the AUX cable directly is perfect! This is clearly a defect in the device's design, causing constant noisy signal to be on to the output AUX port.The other bothersome thing is that -as another reviewer noticed- you cannot activate Siri with it. I tried pressing it twice, or pressing and hold -which turns off the device.In short, Pros:- Amazing aesthetics and solid hardware design and feel.- Good form factor: small device with good cable/charger quality.- It pairs quickly with your phone when you turn on the car.Cons:- Constant humming noise in my speakers when I turn it on (even prior to pairing).- No Siri support from the device.I bought a Bluetooth kit and not a piece of decoration. I was really hoping for this to work. I can live without Siri support, but the humming noise is really a killer. Unfortunately, I am returning this beautiful device, hoping they will fix these issues in future versions.* UPDATE 3/3/2014 *I was happy to receive a replacement BT module for the one I had by the seller. The one I received has the same design, but with Bluetooth 4.0, and other fixes.The updated module has voice messages instead besides the beeps. For example, if it is in pairing mode, you will hear \"Pairing\" through the speakers, or \"Device Connected\" when your phone is paired with the device. Siri is working now as well *hooray*. You have to press the middle button twice, holding the second press for two seconds then releasing it. This will launch Siri. Cool! This solves the Siri problem. I noticed as well that my iPhone pairs much faster compared to the older model.I mainly asked to replace it because the noise on the speakers. With the new device, the noise is still there, but much better. If I lowered the volume on my stereo and raised the volume on my phone, then I would barely notice it. This is good and I am happy with it, unless you want to raise the volume all the way up to blast the car's roof.Another thing I noticed that pairing two phones at the same time worked fine in the older model, but it has been flaky with the new one.All in all, I am satisfied with the newer version of the device, and I am keeping it. I would have given it 5 starts but for the problems listed above.

It also makes a different kind of noise each time it connects with a Bluetooth device.One of the best features of this speaker is its sound quality.

The speaker can easily be placed on any flat surface. Thanks to its fun design this speaker is very versatile in terms of its possible uses. It rubberized exterior makes it very rugged, and even though it is not waterproof I think that this speaker could be used in a variety of outdoors situations.I primarily use this speaker as an external speaker for my old Dell desktop.

I never thought I would need a touchscreen but find myself scrolling and opening pictures with it.  The touch is very responsive and works great.  The display is quite nice and colors show nicely and are not an issue.  There is a bit of a glare in certain situations but it is only with viewing angles that it becomes an issue.  Overall the display will please you.RAMThis unit comes with 2GB - I wanted 4GB but this touchscreen model does not come with it.  The RAM is embedded into the motherboard so it can't be upgraded.  Overall the performance is good even with multiple windows open surfing the internet runs smooth.  Occasionally a picture/flash heavy sight will take a moment to load but otherwise internet surfers will love this device.ProcessorThe Haswell architecture has really done well for this device. Pair this with the SSD drive and start up boot time is less than 5 seconds and power down is just seconds as well.  Updates are done automatically so you won't even know when it is happening.  The device opens apps and video quickly and smoothly - just in general this device does not have any issues with processor lag.StorageYou get 32 GB of SSD on board.  You CAN upgrade this to 128GB.  You would need a few things but it can be done easily but will cost you about $100.  You would need to purchase the 128GB SSD card here on Amazon.  Then , if you have a 4GB USB drive you can create a restore point on it, power down, install the new 128 card, power up with the USB drive in the USB slot and boot from there - the rest will update.  Google Drive offers two years of free 100GB storage but I am not going there as you have to pay after two years.I purchased a Patriot mini USB storage device the size of a dime and plugged it in the 2.0 USB slot for an additional 32GB storage.  If needed I can remove the USB drive and transfer the files to a larger drive ....if needed later on.PortsYou have on the left side a 3.0 USB, HDMI, headphone and power jack.  On the right a 2.0 USB, SD card reader and if you want to lock the device there is a lock hole.  The power cord is unique to the Chromebook and not USB.  Wifi is your main connectivity as there is no Ethernet jack.  However, the Chromebook has full Bluetooth capability and can pair with your devices.Keyboard and track padHere things get a little tricky and you will need to read up online and get your grove on.  This is a bit different than your typical laptop keyboard and track pad.  There are no numbers on the right side or Alt buttons and the keys are individual and raised. The keys are not illuminated.  There are NO left or right click buttons.  The entire track pad is a button.  So, click with one finger and you left click.  Click with TWO fingers you you right click.  Takes some getting used to especially for copy and paste which can be challenging to some.APPSGoogle Play is on board and has a full variety of apps to use - I like it a lot and there are not many limitations - many of the apps you might have on your Android phone can also be on your Chromebook.  Apps like Hangouts, Youtube, Chromecast, etc will all work fine and integrate nicely with the Chromebook.BatteryVery happy at this point as the device is new - time will tell how the battery holds up.  I can surf the internet for hours - about 7 hours at this point and be fine.  Most of the time I am on for only about two hours so battery life is not an issue.Size and weightThe Chrome book is small and light - the display is only 11.6\" but you can still see everything nicely and adjust the font size which I did to Large or extra large if need be.  It is very light between 2.5 - 3 lbs you can hardly feel it on your lap.  It does not get hot and is completely quiet - noise free however there is a fan inside.WEB CAMThere is an HD webcam that works ok in well lit rooms.  In darker lit areas it will be difficult to capture a good image.  Hangouts is what you will use it for most and it works great.  I am not sure if this will work with Skype or if that app is available in the store. Also the camera is front facing - there is no rear facing camera which is fine and how most laptops are set up compared to tablets.PRICEI got this Chromebook primarily for my wife as an internet surfer.  For the price, $309 shipped it isn't terrible.  I would have liked the 4GB of RAM non-touch screen model but that is like finding a unicorn these days.  Although that device only has 16GB SSD storage at least you can upgrade the storage on the Chromebooks where as the RAM is untouchable.ThoughtsI think this device is capable of a lot of things.  Internet and Google will be your primary use for this device.  If you are looking to do word processing and spreadsheets and graphical design this is not your device.  It can do these things with limitations but this is not it's purpose.  Also, even for a young technically savvy person you will need to learn and figure things out such as the track pad and the OS (Operating System) and how it works.  Overall - I am very happy with the Chromebook and love ACER in general.  I have had many of their computers and laptops.  They all work perfectly for me and my style.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A great internet machine with Apps", "unixReviewTime": 1389139200, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2014"}

Christensen \"Frequent traveler, business o...", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "So much could be written about this unit, but I will try to be brief.  If you are a technophile and appreciate great user interface design, you will be sorely disappointed by this unit.  If you will be satisfied by playing DVD-ROM discs burned with MP3s then you may be quite happy.General FeaturesAs stereo head units go, this is a well performing unit at a reasonable price.  The high voltage pre-amp outputs were the feature I was after, along with the dedicated subwoofer channels.  I'm running this with a pair of amps (one 4ch and one mono for the sub).  The ability to tweak and tune the settings is very good, with high and low pass filters, adjustable EQ, sub boost, and lots of other features, it is very good when it comes to setting up the sound the way you want it and customizing it to your unique situation.  In addition, the ability to play DVD-ROM discs with MP3 files (4.7GB of them!) is fantastic.  These are however, the *only* things I like about this unit...App ModeAfter spending a hundred or more dollars on all the special cables needed (including the Cable Jive Dock Extender http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GP08858/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7) I no longer even bother hooking up the iPhone because the user experience is so terribly flawed.  Operation of the &#34;app mode&#34; of this radio is something I would never have released as an actual product, and I find it difficult to believe that ordinary people are able to even use it.  I'm a 25-year tech vet (including stints at programming and product management) and I still find it incredibly difficult, frustrating, and unpredictable to use.  You just never know what will happen when you plug in your iPhone - sometimes you get bizarre &#34;Application not supported&#34; messages, other times nothing happens, and then still other times it will work as it seems to be designed (which is still not great).  There are entire Internet forums dedicated to using these radios - that should have bee my first clue as to how complicated and unpredictable they are to use...Even just trying to use the bluetooth connect is a PITA, as it &#34;takes over&#34; Pandora and eliminates the ability to just use Pandora on the iPhone.  I finally got so frustrated that I disabled the bluetooth &#34;auto connect&#34; on the unit and resorted to the AUX input for Pandora.  iTunes radio seems to work fairly well via Bluetooth, but this uses the &#34;iPod&#34; source rather than the Bluetooth or Pandora source on the unit.Phone Usage (Bluetooth)I wired the mic so that it sits about 8 to 10&#34; from my mouth while I'm driving (on the A pillar) and I have the mic pointed directly at my face.  Most people I have called tell me that I sound like I'm in a wind tunnel or the bottom of an echo chamber.  I'm sticking to my Motorola Whisper bluetooth headset based on this performance, which is another reason I've disabled the bluetooth &#34;auto connect&#34; on the Pioneer so that they don't fight with each other for control of my phone.Reverse CameraI have had intermittent problems since Day 1 with the back-up camera.  Sometimes it works flawlessly, and other times it simply stops working.  I have double-checked all the wiring and the camera itself and I'm fairly confident that these issues are with the head unit itself.  One problem is that when you start your car, the Pioneer  throws up a series of &#34;informational&#34; messages and garbage on the screen that all have to be acknowledged.  If it is in the mood to misbehave, it will also throw up a few error messages (like the aforementioned &#34;Application not supported&#34;).  I'm assuming that displaying these messages competes with the unit's ability to display your camera image (both in terms of processing cycles and actual display).  As a result, about 20% of the time when I start my truck, the reverse image doesn't work at all.  Other times, it takes so long to display, that I've already backed out of the driveway and am on my way by the time the unit is ready to display the backup camera signal.  At times when it refuses to display an image, I will go to the &#34;home&#34; screen and turn the camera &#34;on&#34; (i have the camera wired so that I can view images while driving forward).  The screen will be blank for a good 5 to 15 minutes, then it will suddenly come to life.  Like many of the features of this poorly designed unit, it is unpredictable and unreliable, which really defeats the purpose...In summary, if you just want something that will work easily with your smartphone (at least if it is an iPhone - I cannot comment on Android or Mirrorlink functionality), you are better off to keep looking (or spend up to the latest &#34;CarPlay&#34; compatible units).  But if you are a tech geek who doesn't mind spending hours on Internet forums to figure out how to make stuff work (because the manufacturer did such a poor job creating a usable product) then this might be the right unit for you.I've had the unit in my truck for about a month, and I'm already shopping for a replacement because I just want something that is easy to use and actually works the way I expect it to when I want it to.

As someone who uses dozens and occasionally hundreds of hard drives annually, I know that some will fail sooner than others, but all will ultimately fail. Given that, I will happily use anything from Seagate or western Digital, always making sure that I have more than one copy of important data. If the data is truly worth protecting, it is worth the additional expense of backing it up to more than one device. Period. End of sermon.That said, I never do anything more than test the software hard drive manufacturers include with their drives. Although the quality has improved from years back, the included software is rarely top-of-the line quality. In the case of the software included with this drive, I quite honestly didn't bother. There are far more powerful backup applications to be had and I have them.However, I did review the reviews by trusted third-parties regarding this software and though they all share my basic opinion that you can do better, most concluded that Seagate's included software is adequate for nominal users. Note that their back-up app for mobile devices does not back up applications!So the bottom line for me is quality of the hard drive itself. Seagate doesn't make it easy to find the rotational speed of its drives any more. Part of this is because spin speed is less important than it once was because of newer technologies..I have read both 5,400 and 5,900 RPM.Even with USB 3.0, for demanding purposes like video, this drive is on the slow side: 60MB/s sequential write - dicey if you're using it for demanding video. Read speed is 143.3 MB/s as measure by CrystalMark, which isn't bad.The drive runs cool and seems to be fanless. The enclosure is a plastic cube. There are no diodes, not for power, not for operation, not for anything. I'm not a fan of this, but can live with the omission.Overall then, this is simply an external hard drive to me. A hard drive from a reputable manufacturer with a 2 year warranty and huge capacity. It is not the fastest hard drive, but it isn't advertised as being a super-fast hard drive and its benchmark scores are more than respectable for all but the most demanding purposes. It is quiet, doesn't get very hot and innocuous in its designed. And it's priced right. I'd say go for it.Jerry", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Drive is good - which is all I care about", "unixReviewTime": 1397520000, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2014"}

A few points:1)  it paired without any problem with all my devices--two iPod Touches, a Macbook Pro, an iPad Air (sorry, no Androids). Recognized and paired immediately with all and kept the connection throughout2) As mentioned, I was very pleasantly surprised by the sound, which for this type of speaker was unexpectedly rich.  As is always the case with a speaker this size, the bass will be the downside, but really, it wasn't bad in general and not at all bad for this type of product. Nor was the sound tinny, as can happen sometimes.  Volume is decent--you aren't going to bring the walls down, but then, that's rarely the point of these.  I've had three or four bluetooth speakers and this has so far been my favorite. And really by a pretty good margin.3) it has a nice heft to it, feels solidly constructed and built, but looks pretty good and while it's larger than many bluetooth speakers, it's more vertical so the footprint isn't bad.4) the battery is rechargeable, which is a nice touch, and for me ran nearly five hours the one time I ran it all the way to the end.  If that is unusual when compared to future use I'll update5) it's described as water resistant, but to be honest, I didn't decide to test that by pouring water on it or misting it.  But it's good to know as I'll be using it a lot on the patio while I work or just sit out and enjoy the day.

However, I have come to love the review sample I received for when I am listening to music for leisure instead of transcribing it.The main reason that I love these phones is I remain in the real world with them. What I mean is there is sufficient ambient noise that bleeds through that I can enjoy music in very high fidelity and still hear a timer going off or someone knocking at my door. My other phones isolate me from everything but the music, and while that is good when I can concentrate solely on that, it's not so good when I have to deal with the realities of life.Above I mentioned fidelity. These phones faithfully reproduce the spectrum of frequencies of the music to which I listen. My main test album for any speaker or phone set is Miles Davis'Kind Of Bluebecause the instruments in that album cover the low, mid and high ranges. The bass was so nice in these speakers that I immediately gaveEldee Young & Co. Just for Kicks/Red Holt Look Out!! Look Out!!a listen because the instruments on that album filled in some of the borderline frequencies between low and mid, and mid and high. Again, these speakers faithfully reproduced the sound.  My final test was to listen to a few tracks from30 Ragtime Iconsbecause the stereo separation on that album is wide. These phones crossed over beautifully.From a comfort perspective these are fine for up to three hours, when they start chaffing my ears. Nearly all over-the-ear phones do that to me, so its not as much a criticism as it is an observation. I have been getting about five hours of use between charges, so factor that into your purchase decision if you want phones that will get you through a whole work day in your cubicle.Bottom line: I love the sound and relative comfort, but the most important feature is the fact that these phones do not isolate me from the real world when I am outside my little bubble. With them I can listen to my favorite music with a respectable sound quality without forcing others to listen to it too.

Additionally, the SOUNDSCAPE 8 had a very noticeable amount of hiss when playing music over Bluetooth - far more than any speaker I've ever used. That hiss essentially disappeared on an audio cable, but via Bluetooth, it's very noticeable.That, coupled with the fact that it kept causing Bluetooth interference with my wife's phone and that it used old, slow Bluetooth 2.0 made this one a loser in my book. I should also add that the Bluetooth 2.0 struggled with my higher bitrate sound files - making the audio bitrate fall off and sounding a bit \"crunchy\" when listening via Bluetooth. So to me, my thought was why would you buy a larger, less portable speaker with poor Bluetooth performance for the same price as the SHARKK? Apart from those glitches though, the specs are fairly similar.I just can't get over why you'd put Bluetooth 2.0 (old technology) into a brand-new device design. Sadly, this device could have been amazing - I wanted to love it - but it fell short due to distortion and did a face-plant when it comes to bluetooth performance and sound quality.

I admit I was frustrated after a System Restore failed because of the timing of the update. I called ASUS, and the rep spent an hour on the phone with me. There was nothing that could be done other than a System Refresh, i.e., returning it to factory settings. As of this morning, I am re-registered and all that stuff, and am back to learning more of the capabilities of this computer.***I got this on March 27. The following review is before we got two more tablets (a long story), and the review reflects my inexperience with tablets. As of today - a month later - it's even more difficult to evaluate: 1. The ASUS can do more; it is a real computer, but 2. Android OS are much easier and a lot more fun. Ultimately, what happened was that my wife uses the ASUS for meetings and work, and I use the Galaxy for photography, music, and easing into retirement. They both have the one essential (for us) external storage.***(The March 27 review) I'm fairly new to tablets and Win 8, and nothing seemed to go right the first two days that I had this computer. Thanks to two other early reviewers, I found the stylus (it's part of the case), and learned some useful things about this \"mini-PC.\" That's exactly what it is, a PC with Windows 8. It's only a tablet in size. Note that I'm retired and have little use for a lot of the Win 8 or even ASUS apps, BUT my wife is still working and this will be taking the place of her first generation Kindle Fire ... and then some.My primary reason for getting this is that we wanted a decent sized screen to look at daily photographic shoots while on vacation. That's what we do, and my wife and I can shoot as many as 2,000 pictures a day. We don't want to edit although this Asus can do that, too, but we need at least a 20\" monitor or else we'd go blind.My one need was met after a good deal of difficulty setting up accounts with an extremely small font and a very large stylus (instead of the fantastic stylus it comes with).Pros: After you \"master\" Windows 8 - which is really Windows 7 with widgets and app icons galore. It's pretty easy once that becomes apparent, but without a guide, it does take some time. (I was working in a vacuum.)If you know Windows at all, you should like this OS. It gives you everything even a version of MS Office. The needed Office serial number is in the box. (I had to fish the brochure on Office out of the trash because it looked like an ad.)There is a mini-SDHC port, and since our cameras take the mini-SDHC Class 10 cards, we can pop the cards in this slot and watch them come up on the screen once we go to the external card in the Control Panel. Note: Though we both use P&S; cameras, the photos can be as large as 6-8MB each, and with several hundred, don't expect this tablet to display them as quickly as a a desktop quad core etc. etc. etc. I could put my entire (and that's a big \"entire\") music collection on a 64GB mini-card, and play music that way, but at least at home, I could hook up to Windows Media Player via Bluetooth and play my music anywhere I want without the card. (Small house.)With the supplied Wacom stylus, you can take notes, and it converts handwriting to print. That will come in handy when we're shooting pix in the open space or national parks.Briefly, you can darn near do anything a smart phone does except make calls and have internet access except with wi-fi, but it does more on an 8\" screen that any phone can today...I think.Cons: All the buttons and the stylus are the EXACT same color as the case. They are difficult to find visually. Adding the right case (and I think there may only be one for the Asus Vivo 8 at this time - see link below) really helps because the off/on, volume, and stylus are on the right and the holes give the indication you need as to the button location. That will make sense to you later.Though it has the mini card reader, and those cards now come with up to 128GB storage, I'd like to run more programs using the flash memory than from a card. Perhaps when I find out what I can uninstall, I'll free up enough on-board memory.The screen font is tiny, I mean 2-3 point font tiny. This is why I called Customer Service, and it was a question they couldn't answer, i.e., how to make the screen font bigger. One of the reviewers had the solution, but when I turned the computer on the next day, the font had reverted. We're still looking for an answer. Today, in the manual, we found the answer to making icons larger, but not fonts. Not after 10 days, anyway. (Make that 20 days now.)Some of you may want the selection, but there are so many apps and widget icons that it literally took hours to decide and delete the ones that we will probably never use. We are left with 34 apps and 32 ASUS and Windows widgets. The Windows Accessories and System widgets are of much more use or possible use, perhaps because I understand Windows stuff fairly well.The sign-up forms for ASUS and MS are also tiny and a pain in the neck. You really will need the Wacom stylus that comes with this to fill in the forms. But the Wacom stylus is very thin, doesn't point as well as one would expect when passing over some of the tiny icons (e.g., battery life, wifi status, and all the other things in the taskbar). There is another stylus that quite a few have recommended, but that adds $35 to your costs. The Wacom stylus does well enough for writing notes - short notes - and drawing if you can draw. Neither my wife nor I can draw a straight line, so this may be a moot point.The days after I signed up (without checking the \"getting notices\" box), I started getting email on my desktop PC. Not appreciated.Neither here no there: Just as when you shut down a \"regular\" PC, you have to sign back in (though you can simplify this with a PIN number and I think I saw a way to do away with signing it altogether). Further, Windows updates daily - HIGHLY recommended by me - and so start-up will take a minute or two especially if you haven't used the tablet for a few days. It's not as though I don't have plenty of time, but even in retirement 90 seconds to see a screen just seems like a long time.The screen is acceptable. It's not HD by any means, but since I don't watch movies on anything under 15 inches, this will suffice for YouTube and Wimp.NOTE: Use the manual that is on the tablet, not the downloadable .pdf one. The one on the computer has an icon.I highly recommend this case - which seems to be the only one for this NEW tablet (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOIGT7S/ref=pe_385040_30332190_TE_M3T1_ST1_dp_3) - and I'm listing it here because it's so darn hard to find on Amazon as of 3/29/14Three of these cons were sufficient for me to delete one star, but overall I am impressed.

Let me just say, the display on this thing is far and away the best display I have seen on any device I've ever used, included the iPad Retina's!Not only is the resolution very high, but since the tablet is 8.4&#34;, the PPI is very dense as well. I'm not sure the exact number, but it's the best I've seen.The speakers are also surprisingly terrific. They are loud and clarity is good.I really enjoy the extra features on the tablet like the Multi-Window mode where you can view two apps on the screen at the same time. Small apps like the Calendar app and Email app are very good as well.I am happy that Samsung finally ditched the menu button on this tablet. It now adheres to more of the Android guidelines, although still have physical keys instead of on-screen keys. That's ok though, I think people have grown to like the physical home button.I don't use Samsung Voice or some of the other Samsung apps, but it has the full Google Play services which includes the terrific Google Now experience. The apps on the Play Store rival and in many cases, surpass those on the Apple App Store.The only thing average on this tablet is the price. At $399, you can get a great little 7-inch tablet, the Nexus 7, for only $229.

I have discovered playbook app and the ability to upload my rather extensive book library.  I use calibre with a drm removal program so that I can have all of the books I purchased available anywhere.I have had some issues getting this to sync with my samsung tv.  I have the remote control working and am able to control my tv just fine but I just can not get the screen mirroring to work.  It acts like it is going to connect and show up on my tv screen but then fails.  If anyone has an idea as to what I am doing wrong I would welcome your advise.It continues to function great and is getting free updates from Samsung for software.  I really like the rubber back....around the house i do not need a cover.So you are thinking about buying one of these.  They are rather high in price but you do get a nice large screen and a LOT of free software.....NOT what I would say is bloat ware.  For me bloatware consists of basic come ons that give me a few days for free and then I have to pay more money.  While that is true about some of the software much of what Samsung offers up is FREE>I will not simply cut copy and paste the specs.  You can see those for yourself.This is a new type of device.  A natural evolution of a common device.  It is a new and fresh approach to this whole new category of consumer tablets.  New in that they are still in their diaper stage........ much change has happened to size and weight.  Screens have become better and functions have increased.I like this device.  I am still learning how to use it.  My usage of windows 8.1 definitely helped me get going on this.  Sure I know this is android but it does share some common characteristics with the surface pro2...... i.e......you can have multiple applications running side by side.I like using the pen.  It is unlike any other pen I have used.  It communicates with the screen long before you ever touch it.  It is stowed in the side of the device.  I did not know this so I looked back through the box thinking they had forgotten to send it to me......then I found it.I was able to sync up my microsoft exchange account, my cox account, calendars, contacts, etc....I am able to use the amazon mp3 app to listen to my music..... I uploaded ALL of my music to the amazon mp3 cloud many months ago.Dropbox works fine as does OneDrive.Like many people I have vision problems.  Vision problems are not something for the aged it affects millions of people of all ages.The accessibility options are cool.  I have my voice over set for British female voice.  She sounds sexy.  I think I would like to meet her....anyone have Raj's twitter account..... Since he found Siri maybe he can help me find my sexy British voice......(don't tell my wife that I am looking for her)Sooooo with the pen out you just hover around the screen and it tells you exactly where you are.  Touch the icon for settings or samsung apps and she will talk you through it all.  I have the power button set so that if I hold it down for two seconds it pulls up the accessibility options so I can turn her off just as easily as she turns me on.One caveat with the voice over on is that you HAVE to use the pen..... finger touch does not work to change pages etc.....Playbook.....  a great way to get books and a FANTASTIC way for those of us with vision problems to get the text just right.Now that I have been using my new iPad Air and this Galaxy note for reading I fully realize what I was missing using my amazon HDX 8.9.  You can get the fonts way larger on the iPad Air and the Galaxy note than the amazon device.  When i say bigger i mean BIGGER.  We are talking about the difference between say 40 font and 60 font.PLUS with the added real estate of the galaxy I can get around 15 words per page.  The playbook app also has free and always on text to speech.  You just move the pen to the top and click start speech.Voce over works pretty much like on my iMac.  It works with programs on the note.  i.e...... Netflix.... voice over works with it and will read me what is on the screen.  A big plus for those of us with vision problems.  No more trying to find my high powered glasses...I can just activate voice over and use my lower powered 5.0 magnification glasses.Sadly when I use the google playbook I have to listen to there rather robotic female american voice....... please google let me use the samsung british voice.  I think I love her.I bought one case for this but it just is not what I really want.  I have two of the ionic brand on order.

That experience was one of the main reasons I went with Samsung again.  Unfortunately, my experience with this 65-inch LED unit hasn't been as favorable.First off, the picture itself, when things are working correctly, is amazingly good.  When things are working correctly.My first unit had flash-lighting in all four corners, and it was really bad in the bottom corners.  I kept it for a week, hoping I could get used to it, but it was very noticeable and distracting in any semi dark scene.  I finally decided to send it back and got my new unit yesterday.  While the new unit still has some flash-lighting, it's nowhere near as bad as the previous unit, so I'm going to live with it.Auto-motion plus (AMP).  This feature appears to be severely broken.  Do a search on it and you'll find that many people have problems with it.  What's disturbing is that some of these AMP problems go back a couple of years, so it's not a new issue.  The highest setting I can use is &#34;clear&#34;, which is the lowest AMP setting.  Any setting above that and I get video stuttering and/or the &#34;soap opera&#34; effect.Also, I was pretty excited to get a TV that has built-in support for Amazon and Netflix.  Unfortunately, the software seems buggy.  After I watched an Amazon movie a couple of nights ago, the Amazon app crashed on me.  Never had that happen with the Amazon app on the PS4.Also, the web browser seems slow and buggy at times.I'm hopeful that a future firmware upgrade will address some of the software issues.  However, it seems like companies are always moving on to next year's models so support for existing models seems to be getting worse and worse.I think picture wise the TV is probably a 4/5 stars but for the money I spent I expected more which is why I gave it a 3/5 stars.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Picture is nice but software stinks", "unixReviewTime": 1399766400, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2014"}

They've clearly put a great deal of thought into the bridge between the TV and computer-like experience and it's both intuitive and simple to use. The 3D works flawlessly with the included glasses though it feels a little gimmicky and in reality is the sort of thing you can use once in a while but not every day - Avatar looks great on the TV though it suffers from the smallness of the screen. It seems that 3D really requires a massive area to be as convincing as in the movie theaters.Set up is easy, the Wii-style remote works well (especially if you're used to these gaming controls) and is great for entering text compared with a standard remote. The device overall is aesthetically pleasing and fits in with a modern-style lounge or living room environment. The audio isn't bad by itself considering the size of the speakers and compares very favorably with other high-end TVs at this price point but truthfully you're going to want a separate sound system if you're investing this heavily in home entertainment.The elephant in the room is the problem that other reviewers have described and it's been driving me crazy. There's a constant dirty screen effect that starts to become really annoying. At first I was wondering if it was caused by compression artifacts but I've played the same scenes on different TVs and this is the only one that features a constant haze like the screen isn't cleaned properly. It's particularly noticeable with rapid movement too (such as when watching sports). It's a serious issue that I've not seen before on any 50&#34;+ TV screen and even others in my household keep asking what's wrong with the TV.By itself, this might be manageable but it's compounded by a bizarre auto-dimming effect that completely screws up the transition between dark and light scenes in a film. It's like the TV is auto-adjusting the brightness and there doesn't seem to be any way to disable the 'feature'. It's a real shame since the rest of the TV is a 5-star, high quality piece of hardware and it fails at this important but critical point. I've switched back to my 2-year old Phillips which has a worse UI but at least doesn't distract when playing video. Hopefully they can push out a firmware update to fix the problems and if they do, I'll post a new review.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great UI, sleek design but major dimming problems", "unixReviewTime": 1399593600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2014"}

Upon arrival,I unpacked the box to find the instructions, legs and screws for the TV, power cable, remote, two pair of 3D glasses and some stuff to secure the TV to the wall if needed and group wires. Everything looked pretty easy.I screwed the legs to the TV as the instructions clearly stated to do, placed it on the table plugged my cables in and I was ready to go. Once I put a battery I provided in the remote I had spent about 10 minutes total on the setup That was great.Once turning the TV on it asked for internet access info. I use a router for the house so I added my password, done. Next it was cable provider info, I use DirecTV and that was simple as well I just told it which channel I receive cable on and which port I had it hooked to. Now I was about fifteen minutes into the setup and ready to watch TV!The picture quality is amazing and with the TV being so large I saw things on my regular shows that I had never noticed before. I feel in love with this TV with the very first viewing. However, there was so much more to see. I went to You Tube to find a 3D video. I watched the Avatar trailer in 3D. Wow, I can't believe it. It really is 3D. What is more amazing is I can watch all my You Tube videos on a 55inch screen. I had to adjust the audio to suit TV and my videos but it was easy to find on the menu.The menu appears on the bottom of the screen when you push the button on the remote. you can scroll through it easily and adjust it by moving the icons you use more frequently closer to the front. The remote looks like something from a space age movie. It is sleek and shaped like an elongated diamond. It has a tracker ball type thing in the middle that you can use to move the mouse around. Yes an arrow appears on the screen by shaking the remote and you move it around to make selections like the computer. Pretty cool if you ask me.I love that I can surf the net too. I was able to pull up and view all areas of my website.  My granddaughter is super excited about the game features and LG store. The apps are very easy to use. The first time you use them they have to update. It only takes a few seconds. You can choose to use HULU plus, VUDU, or Netflix to purchase movies or TV shows too. All in all it was very easy to set up and easy to use! The picture quality is amazing and the sound quality is good too. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a 3D TV or an HD TV because the cost is considerably less expensive than other name brands. It is definitely a product that will give you more than you imagined. Each day I am amazed at the different features I find.I just have two problems now. One is keeping everyone in my household from consuming it and two is making myself turn it off to do what I need to do in my life.

Sunvalleytek sends out follow up emails to those who have purchased their products and clearly states they are readily available to provide support for their products. In recent years I have learned to expect that when nobody in the Support Department answers the call, then they are not working, and the product they are pushing probably won't work either. So I look elsewhere.I'm fascinated by mobile gadgets that actually accomplish what the company claims they will do. In contrast to the many glitches arising with another company's product that basically does the exact same thing as the HooToo, it looks like the team at Sunvalleytek has formulated some useful products that can provide reliable services for travelers. As time progresses, some of the usefulness of the TripMate Elite will be swallowed up by mobile technology that also never rests and continually advances. For instance, a good solid signal for the new 4G/LTE standard will eliminate the need for a WiFi connection for streaming movies and music directly from the Web. Likewise, most of the newer smartphones and tablets accept a microSD card up to 128GB that can hold an incredible amount of movies, music, and snapshots. At least enough movies to last a long rainy weekend. Additionally, unlimited data services have eliminated the enormous rates once associated with downloading multimedia from the Web. As a result, those still using 3G mobile services have more to gain using the TripMate Elite. But that doesn't demean the services available to everyone else as well.After working with the TripMate Elite for a few days, I'm getting the idea the several reviews never really put the Elite through its paces enough to reveal how many devices can be streamed and for how long without the HooToo requiring a recharge. The Windows software available fore the TripMate allows all abilities common to downloading, storing, and enjoying everything the Web has to offer. Every mobile device the TripMate app from Google PLay is installed on, will allow streaming from a USB device via the TripMate and will also transfer files from your device to a USB memory device. There are three abilities that may be of significance to travelers: one being the emergency phone charger; it will also provide a local wireless connection allowing one or more mobile devices to stream multimedia from a USB memory device which is a reliable source of entertainment while on the move; and third it will provide WiFi if there is an Ethernet connector in places such as a hotel room, and in some cases might even extend a public WiFi network for your own private use. That's a very useful device indeed.Those with some previous experience setting up routers and WiFi systems will likely find the TripMate Elite very simple to work with and it can be made somewhat secure. Yes it will extend the range of your home or work network (wired or wireless), but if your WiFi is hidden, the TripMate Elite won't find it wirelessly. For those with no idea about where to start, then maybe the several reviews found at YouTube will help to make some sense on how to use the TripMate Elite.The HooToo is boxed with a manual complete with illustrations and the basics that may be sufficient for some users, but it is far from being a complete step by step manual that explains each provision for proper setup and getting maximum potential from using it. Since there was one provision that had me stumped on how to activate it, I requested assistance from Sunvalleytek who answered my request promptly with an explanation and step by step instructions on how to get that provision operational, and that completely fixed the problem.In conclusion, the HooToo TripMate Elite is a versatile and reliable mobile device that works as claimed and has excellent backing by the company that designed it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Have HooToo, Will Travel", "unixReviewTime": 1404777600, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2014"}

I've never purchased a product because it sports a celebrity endorsement or name. Since I had the opportunity to review a pair for no charge, and I'm a SW fan, it was a no brainer.  The packaging is impressive and a tree-huggers worst nightmare. Plastic, magnets, and all types of stuff that will be in the landfill long after I'm gone. Just what an evil galactic empire would envision.  I gave the box to a friends daughter - its now a house for her small dinosaurs. Surprisingly, this little 2 year old is a SW fan. She watched me unboxing and exclaimed &#34;Stormtrooper!!!&#34; She now wears the outer sleeve as a helmet. I eventually cut eye holes. It's a perfect fit.  Fun for the entire family.As for the important stuff - what's in the box.  The carrying case is cool, embossed with the Star Wars logo. Wait - it's a Galactic Football! Since I'm in my mid 50's, I feel a little odd carrying it.  The cable has a 90 degree angle where it connects to your player, and is an anti-tangle design.  There is a single control about a foot down the cord from the headset.  On my iPod this pauses/plays, reads off the current playing title, and allows you to select favorites. This also houses the mic. There's also a little black piece of cloth. I assume for polishing the plastic.  I told the kid it's part of Darth Vader's cloak. I haven't seen it since.There's also some stuff to feed 50's ego (photo, etc.) and a cool stormtrooper poster. Too bad it's folded in 1/4's. Still, it went on the garage wall.  Hey, I may be in my 50's, but I'm still a SW fan! Oh yea - there's also a sheet of decals. The Stormtrooper helmet went on the side of my PC, the rest to the two year old to play with.The headphones. You're probably paying a 20% premium for the Star Wars branding.  I have the Stormtrooper version, so it's all glossy white and black.  They do look and feel a little cheap, but they are very light weight and actually a LOT stronger than you'd think.  They are also smaller than many headsets.  The pads are memory foam, the hinges are metal.  The helmet insignia is about 1/8&#34; thick and looks to be molded in the headset.  Not sure how long it will be white after a few months of use.As for the sound.  Wow. These are literally the first headphones I've owned that vibrate and bounce to heavy bass. Seriously.  &#34;Quiescent Passive Noise Cancellation&#34; - well, that's a fancy way of saying outside sounds are reduced a lot, but not entirely.  If you're traveling and have these anywhere past 1/4 volume, the people next to you will hear something.  If you turn the volume up all the way, your neighbors will probably complain. Noise cancellation goes both ways. I'm really wondering what these will be like on the ski hill, cranked.I've worn them for three hours straight - and they are really comfortable. The memory foam contours nicely, and the pressure from the set is snug, but not too tight.  The  set is also very light - surprisingly so. They do feel a little small at first, but I got used to that in a few seconds. My one complaint? Something - I don't know if it's the synthetic covering over the foam or the foam itself - has a terrible chemical stink. They've been out of the package for a couple of days and it's still there.The overall sound is great, and obviously a little heavy on the bass. The higher the volume, the higher the bass. Highs and mids are also decent. My favorites for testing - Centhron's &#34;Dreckst&uuml;ck&#34;, Beethoven's 9th, 4th movement, and Pink Floyds DSOTM &#34;The Great Gig in the Sky&#34; and &#34;Brain Damage&#34;, and finally Jarre's &#34;Equinoxe Part 2&#34; all sounded great. I thought these were going to shake loose during Dreckst&uuml;ck.Overall I like these. I'd say these are equivalent to $130-$150 headphones.  So where does the extra $$ go?

They sound like what you'd expect from a Bose product -- bass-heavy but otherwise pretty balanced.  I believe where these 'buds truly shine, though, is in the \"Stayhear\" fancy earbud tip things.  For whatever reason, I've never really found an ear bud that fits well, stays in while working out, and sounds great.  But these FINALLY can pull it off!NOTE: The controls don't seem to work for DROIDs (or at least the S3).  The middle button will pause/play Spotify, but you can't use them for calls, volume, etc.  Kind of a bummer in that regard.FIT / USE FOR EXERCISE - 5/5Staying in during a long run while you're getting sweatier seems to be the Achilles heel of almost every pair of earbuds I own.  Maybe I have elvin ears or something, I don't know.  But these don't go IN your ears and that's exceptional.  The little wings of the earbuds secure themselves better than you can imagine.  I've actually tried to knock them out by shaking and jumping around to see where they'd falter and haven't been successful.  They've never fallen out.  Ever.  That says something.  They take a couple wears to get used to, I felt like something was tickling my ear for the first few minutes, but they're surprisingly comfortable.The other really nice part about these is that they kind of rest OUTSIDE of your ears.  This also means that (as gross as it is) they are less apt to get all gunked up with ear wax over time.  I haven't had them for terribly long, but I think it'd take a lot to get these dirty, even after a year or so of use.SOUND - 5/5Like I said, they sound great and like a Bose product.  They have a nice range, though on some music it does feel like the bass is getting pushed so hard that it maxes out and kind of gets washed.  Alas, they sound superb and I'm generally not a \"Bose guy.\"  One thing to consider is that -- sitting outside of your actual ear canal like they do -- they don't really block out ambient noise.  When using them at my computer, I can still hear the click of my mouse, for instance.  This is great for exercising or anywhere you want to remain a bit aware of your surroundings.  If you're looking for a pair of isolating headphones, though, they won't cut it.  I actually have a LOT of headphones near this price range and this is probably the best-sounding of them all.OTHER \"STUFF\" - 2/5Honestly, the things Bose highlights for this generation of headphones just doesn't do it for me.  Personally, I think they're a bit ugly and tend to remind me of those crazy 80s and 90s workout clothes.  The little \"case\" they came with is a bit flimsy and stiff.  It actually feels like cloth-wrapped cardboard.  But I felt that all of this stuff was \"extra\" and didn't really take away from the buds at all.In all, these are solid earbuds that you'll love.

{"reviewerID": "A2DKQQIZ793AV5", "asin": "B00ISRUFSY", "reviewerName": "Twister", "helpful": [14, 15], "reviewText": "It's clear that BlueAnt done their homework really well by studying the competition to come up with a spec, a fitment, and accessories to make everybody happy. Arrived in a very impressive packaging, their presentation showed almost realistic-like 3D water droplets on top of the tray where these sportbuds were sitting. I was honestly expecting to see yet another variation of two earbuds connected by a cable with in-line remote. To my surprise Pump HD has a behind the ear design, but it looked very slick and modern, not like some other headsets I've seen in the past that resemble a hearing aid. I also noticed how lightweight Pumps felt in my hand and hardly even noticeable once placed around my ears. One common problem with earbuds is finding proper eartips for the best fitment to seal your ear canal and also to make sure they won't fall out of your ears during extreme activities. Here, though Blueant included a very generous selection of a total of 7 pairs of eartips (doubles of each S/M/L pairs and a pair of Comply premium awareness tips), and 2 pairs of stabilizers, and a separate cable zip - all this was to enhance the sound isolation and customize cable length. The fitment itself was taken care of by behind the ear design.The headset itself has IP67 rating which guarantees to withstand heavy exposure to wet condition. With a Teflon coating and Kevlar shielding, it blocks water, salt, dust and sweat from entering the headphone set. Also, the micro-usb recharging port (with a high quality cable included in accessories) has a durable seal cap. All the Bluetooth button controls are sealed as well. The included blue eartips seems to be made out of durable silicone material and with a right size selection provide a decent noise isolation. But if you need to be aware of your surrounding, Blueant also included a pair of premium Comply Awareness tips that allow background noise. To compliment it's durable built, Pump also includes a durable lasting battery for up to 8hr of play - a very impressive performance!Wireless pair up was very easy, and it got connected to my phone and media audio without any problem. It supports all the common Bluetooth profiles, such as A2DP, AVRCP, HFP, and HSP. Using multifunction Play button, easily distinguished by raised profile on a side of right earpiece behind your ear, you can play/pause and pick up a call with ease. Volume up/down buttons, shaped as plus and minus, are used to change the volume and also to skip tracks next/prev. The wireless range was very impressive as well, I was about 50+ feet away from my phone across 2 rooms and it was playing without a problem. Blueant claims 100ft wireless distance which I still have to test, but in my opinion it's probably in the open area and with hair out of the way without covering headphones. I also run a number of calling tests, and it sounded very clear on both ends.Now, let's see how this sound translates into steaming audio. Here, things got a little more interesting. Though using Bluetooth 3.0, Pump actually supports AptX and AAC codecs to provide high quality audio without a typical wireless compression. As a matter of fact, this is a first time ever I have seen a non-audiophile company to disclose frequency response of their headphones. They are definitely very proud of their 12.5mm customized dynamic driver, and v-shaped sound tuning. But for me it was a mix bag of impressions. It's not fair to judge sport headphones comparing them to audiophile in-ears, but sound is as important as the durability and design appeal. These headphones has a very high emphasis on deep punchy bass. When you exercising - beat is driving your motion, and Pump will really pump you up with a strong beat! Mids were recessed, typical for v-shape sound, but then toward the upper mids and treble instead of going back up, it rolled off down killing the clarity and the sparkle of high frequencies. As a result, overall sound has a nice driving rhythm but it's veiled with overpowering bass and not enough clarity and details in vocals. So what does it mean? By default with your smartphone audio player without any EQ setting the sound might not be your cup of tea (it wasn't mine). The good news - it can be easily corrected with EQ by boosting upper mids and highs around 5k region.  I guess this is just a general comment for a lot of sport headphones where I would prefer to have a more balanced sound with some default bass enhancement and let me tweak EQ further to fine tune it, rather than tweaking EQ setting for different headphones in order to enjoy it from get go.If you are into pushing yourself to the limit while exercising, if you find that you have to go through a new pair of headphones every few months because they break under your sweat, if you have to constantly adjust the fitment of your current headphones because they don't stay in place, and if you are not getting enough of daily &#34;bass&#34; to drive you to your next workout goal - Pump HD is calling your name!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The most durable sport headphones with a great bass to pump you up! :)", "unixReviewTime": 1400025600, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2014"}

I just recently cut my cable and switched to a ROKU box.  I kind of slowly cut the cable.  I went from 200+ channels, to 160 channels, to basic cable of about 20 channels.  The basic cable had terrible reception so I wondered why I was paying $25 per month for it when I could get the channels I watched for free in HD with an antenna.  I did a lot of research on Amazon and read countless reviews before purchasing this antenna.  I always use Amazon for my product research.  This item had pretty good reviews and was 1/4 the price of the item I was considering prior to purchasing this one.  It's the same basic design as the slightly bigger and more expensive one.  I plugged it in and was blown away by the picture quality!  Going from the cable companies standard definition to this is night and day.  I'm assuming Comcast dumbs down the reception so you will pay more for their step up service.  The picture quality from this antenna is just as good or better than any HD I've ever seen.  The major bonus is the size.  I have mine installed with 10lb two-sided indoor/outdoor tape behind a round clock above my HDTV.  All you see is the small cord coming out from the clock and it just looks like the clock as a cord.  You can experiment a bit with placement for signal strength but honestly no matter where I placed this antenna it came in good.  I tried the suction cup that comes with it behind the TV and that wasn't as good as hanging it above the TV.  Also, the ONLY negative I can give this item is the little sticky pad that comes with the suction cup stand to stick the antenna on the wall or on a table.  It is not that sticky and it kept falling over.  You really don't need it or the stand if you use two-sided industrial tape.

So I ordered this to see how it stacks up. I find it to be very complete, with comparable feature sets (and even some additional features), but to have a pretty steep learning curve for current Office users.Installation went fine, with no problems. The package comes with Wordperfect for writing, Quattro Pro for spreadsheets, Presentation for slide shows, a program called Lightning to integrate files, and Roxio Secure Burn (used to write secure files to CDs). They also provide a lot of fonts and clipart. The installation optionally puts in some Windows filters so that the operating system can read Office X7 file formats.Overall Impressions:I like the fact that they didn't go to a \"ribbon interface\"; the traditional menus are much easier for me to navigate, even though I have to learn where everything is versus where I remember from MS Office. I found WordPerfect to be the easiest to use, followed by Quattro Pro, and then Presentations. In general, I found the context menus to be a bit better in Office. All of the programs will read and write MS Office files, although complicated formats may need massaging before they look the same. The three main software programs can integrate well (insert spreadsheet into a document, etc). The package is a bit pricy, but comparable to Office products.WordPerfect:This word processor can do everything anyone could want, and it was reasonably easy to learn. There are a couple of good things to note here. The program can save as PDF files, which is nice, and it can create PDF forms as well; this is a great feature for those who construct these files. It also has an e-book publishing feature. This allows one to either write or assemble an E-book, and then publish it in a format that can be used by any ebook read that can read Mobi or EPUB formats. I tried it, and it is powerful and still simple to use. WordPerfect is commonly used in the legal profession, and there are some menus that seem tailored to that (like a Redact function, for example).Quattro Pro:The spreadsheet works fine, although once again there is a steep learning curve. I like the fact that even though they use different notation for formulas, they still accept Excel format (and convert it to Quattro Pro when you enter it). I didn't go through and directly compare the numbers, bit it seems to me that Excel has more functions than Quattro Pro. This program in particular has some additional work group collaboration tools.Presentations:I find the interface to be a bit less intuitive than MS Office, although once I found any particular feature it was fairly simple to use. It imported Powerpont slides, but they required a lot of retouching; the graphics in particular did not look right, and it was hopeless in trying to match the slide transitions - they had to be completely redone. One thing I didn't like was the interface; one has to switch back and forth between various views. Powerpoint has a summary of each slide on the left that can be used to navigate, copy, etc. This package could use some additional interface tweaks to be simpler and easier. Context menus did not seem to be as powerful or useful as in Office.Lightening:This is a small note taking program that allows one to integrate various documents, pictures, and notes into one interface. I suppose it is supposed to compete with MS OneNote, but it is not nearly as powerful. I didn't particularly like it and will continue using Evernote instead.The Roxio Secure Burn program works transparently; just drag the files to the DVD or CD drive and it goes into operation. It works well.Summary: If you don't want to use MS Office, and don't mind a lot of re-learning, this is a solid package.

{"reviewerID": "AT6O8DA1EHCIW", "asin": "B00JPJ33MO", "reviewerName": "Alan Moore \"evilcat\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "The Onkyo TX-NR737 is a big home cinema receiver with a huge laundry list of features. It&#8217;s THX Certified, will fire up to a 7.2 surround system, and can power two other rooms. It has 7 HDMI sockets, can upscale analogue signals, receive from a DLNA server, and has wi-fi built in, even a phono port for a turntable. In terms of features, this is a good step up from a $200 - $500 receiver, and while it has a lot of power and &#8216;goes up to 11&#8217;, the quality of the sound when playing music is not significantly different from a lower-price receiver. You&#8217;re paying for the list of features, and there have been a few corners cut to get that list to be so long.THX Certified Surround, according to the brochure, will let you &#8216;Hear Movies Precisely As the Director Intended&#8217;. Apparently, &#8217;every aspect of audio performance meets rigorous THX standards for theater-reference sound.&#8217; I have no reason to doubt this, but I didn&#8217;t have any directors available to confirm their movies were being reproduced accurately. Treat this as marketing guff, because it will frankly depend on the quality of the media you&#8217;re playing, be that DVD, Blu-Ray or whatever.7 HDMI inputs is great news for homes with ever growing collections of devices. I fitted a Comcast cable box, and Blu-Ray player, an Xbox 360, a multi-region DVD player and an Apple TV. One caveat: The seventh HDMI is on the front panel. If you are going to have seven devices permanently connected, there will be one ugly cable visible at all times. Also, while the facility for handling 4k video is available, it&#8217;s actually not on every input: &#8216;Five of the receiver&#8217;s seven HDMI inputs are based on the latest HDMI specification to support 4K video at 50/60 frames per second and 21:9 aspect ratio for theater-reference movie display.&#8217; So be careful setting up. Why it&#8217;s only on five, I have no idea. That&#8217;s the corner cutting I already mentioned.In fact, the HDMI inputs have another case of corner-cutting: &#8216;HDCP 2.2 for future 4K and Premium Studio Content&#8217;, is available, since the movie studios do like to punish us consumers for handing over our cash so we can see the latest comic book adaption, remake or sequel. This feature, however, &#8216;supports the latest HDCP 2.2 DRM copy protection standard via HDMI Input 3 and the main output.&#8217; which means this highly touted feature is only available on one input. If you have two devices sending such content, tough luck.As it is, I can&#8217;t review these wonderful future-proofing features as I have neither 4k content, nor a 4k TV. Nice to know they&#8217;re present, but pay attention to which ports get which inputs when setting up.The TX-NR737 has Wi-Fi built in, and it&#8217;s incredibly easy to use. It attached to my wi-fi network without a hitch, and has not displayed any issues since. It&#8217;s sitting in a room with 8 other wi-fi connected devices and it just works.There are lots of networked options available, and the receiver will talk to DLNA services. Via DLNA, &#8216;Almost every hi-res and lossless format is supported, from gapless FLAC and WAV to ALAC and WMA&#8217;. This is true: I set up Plex Server on my Mac and there was no problem receiving audio of all kinds. There is some corner-cutting going on, and for some reason Onkyo decided to exclude video capabilities from their DLNA client. That&#8217;s a shame. My ~$100 Blu-Ray player does both, and being a Sony, has a nicer interface. I can&#8217;t think of a reason to use the receiver for DLNA sources if an attached device does it better.One last thing about connecting devices: analogue upscaling is great for reducing the number of cables going in and out of the receiver. Cheaper receivers generally don&#8217;t have component in/out any more, although my 3-year old Yamaha does. But what a pain, as it only sent the signal to the component out, meaning I had to switch inputs on the TV and run another cable. The Onkyo, however, upscales the component in signal to 1080p and outputs it to HDMI. Perfect! Well, it would be, if they hadn't cut corners again.Before HDMI, component was the way to output progressive, non-interlaced pictures from a games console or a DVD player. That progressive output is sharper and more stable, with less color bleed than other analogue signals. The pricey component adapter for the Wii was well worth it, since suddenly the picture looked good, rather than fuzzy.In the Onkyo manual, it decrees that component signals to be upscaled must be interlaced, not progressive. Why? There&#8217;s no logic in that decision. I set the Wii back to interlaced and it looked as bad as it did through a cheap composite cable. Fuzzy, blurry, and bleeding colour. Whatever processing the Onkyo was doing (and I confirmed it was up converting to 1080p) made no discernible difference. It also seems you can&#8217;t run both HDMI and component out at the same time, soI plugged the Wii into the TV, set it back to progressive, and output the TV audio to the receiver. What a waste of a potentially great feature.One great benefit of moving up the price chain with this receiver was the on-screen setup. Everything you do appears on the control panel and on your TV screen. Menus are easy to navigate, it&#8217;s great to see where you are and so much easier than kneeling in front of the receiver with a remote, following arcane instructions from a manual. Great work there, Onkyo.Other nice features include binding posts for all speaker outputs, which enables the use of banana plugs: most cheaper receivers will offer posts on the front left and right outputs, then force you back to those fiddly little clips for the rest. Not here. I rewired my speakers with 12 gauge speaker wire (really thick cables) from MonoPrice, terminated them with closed banana plugs from the same place, and plugged them in. Easy. Thanks, Onkyo.The TX-NR737 provides AccuEQ Room Calibration. Room calibration is another feature low-end amps/receivers don;t have. Place a microphone in the optimal listening position and the speakers fire a bunch of test tones to determine the acoustics of your room, then adjust the settings to be optimal. I gave it a tough test, since our room has the TV (with front and center speakers and subwoofer) in a corner, and two surrounds at the far edges of the opposite wall. In the optimal viewing position, this means all the speakers are firing directly at you from 12ft, but surround left is above the left ear, while surround right is 8ft away to the right. Not optimal, I admit, but those are the constraints. The AccuEQ system did configure the room properly, knocking down the volume of that left surround. It slightly mis-configured my floor standing front speakers, which can produce deep, directional bass (as opposed to a subwoofer, which just fires all the deep notes into the room from one point). All in all, I&#8217;d say it did a good job, but as that seating position is only one of several, I undid its setup and defined it manually.Setting up the remote control to control other appliances worked nicely, too: it automatically controls the Apple TV and found the TV quickly. I could use it to control the Comcast box, but the layout of the remote isn&#8217;t too appropriate for that, and I prefer to use the dedicated remotes for Blu Ray and DVD. With the on-screen menus, this was much less of a guessing game than on cheaper receivers.So let&#8217;s finish with sound quality: normally this would be the most important thing to cover, but with so many bells and whistles to cover, the impression is that this was not the focus of  the engineers at Onkyo when designing this receiver: the laundry list for marketing purposes was.The system may offer &#8216;thunderous 7.2-channel surround-sound&#8217;, and multi-zone audio, but I did not test them. My speaker set up is made up of the surrounds, centre and subwoofer from a Yamaha HTIAB system purchased a few years back, augmented with the wonderful Pioneer SP-FS52 floor standing speakers, which outclass almost everything up to a $500 pair for half the price.I like my audio direct, with no manipulation: mono should be duplicated through the two front speakers, stereo should not be forced into a fake surround sound, and so on. I bought floor standers so I could play stereo music without turning on the subwoofer. That&#8217;s where 7.2 presents an issue. I could have unplugged the speakers from my office and tested the 7-channel surround, but I only found one 6.1 movie and two 7.1 movies in my collection. Since all the rest were 5.1, that would mean the receiver was extrapolating sounds from those channels and spreading them amongst the extra two. That seems to me to not be &#8216;how the director intended&#8217;. In the end, I stayed with 5.1 sound for testing.My findings are simple: this receiver pumps out a lot of power. My old receiver was capable of 100w/channel but it&#8217;s clear to me that it was not pushing air out of the speakers like the Onkyo. Movies sound great. The more blockbuster the movie, the better it sounds. If I owned anything by Michael Bay, I bet it would sound great. My only query is the bass balance: remember, this system determined my floor standers could not output enough bass and should defer to the woofer. I undid that setting, and yet the bass is still thunderous. I noticed it is actually somewhat overpowering with music, and this includes music in movies. I had to increase the volume pif the centre channel speaker, because the bass of the background music was drowning out the dialogue. To give an idea of how much bass there was, I turned down the subwoofer&#8217;s volume before realizing the bass was actually coming from the floor standers. I&#8217;m not going to knock any points off here though, since it may be my mis-matched speaker setup that&#8217;s exacerbating the bass issue with movies. On the other hand, I tried out my usual array of music tests in pure stereo, and found the bass a little overwhelming there too.It is clear to me, however, that the quality of the sound is no better than a cheap receiver: it is louder, more powerful, but it does not extract any more detail or add clarity. It is definitely a receiver for watching movies, and not particularly musical. It&#8217;s great for movies and has a lot of features, even if a few of them have been half-baked. Just be aware of the limitations of some features, as they may not be exactly what the laundry list suggests. If you need a central controller for many different devices, this is a good choice.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Lots of features, thunderous sound, but a few disappointing corners have been cut.", "unixReviewTime": 1402012800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2014"}

I find it to to have strange design features, to offer excellent protection, and to be very well constructed, but a bit bulky to carry.The bag is really unusually designed. One side has a couple of clips that close a sort of top piece over a flap and zipper. The flap is designed for a phone, and the zipper reveals a compartment for small items like flash cards. This would seem to be the side that opens the internal bag - but it isn't! Instead, the entire top of the bag unzips from what would be the opposite side (the one that is next to the body when carried). It takes a little getting used to. There are two additional clips on each side; the four together make for a compression strap support system, which is more frequently seen on backpacks, and does provide more strength. The front straps are useful for clipping in a small tripod. Once you finally figure out how to open the zipper, the inside is revealed to be a bag-within-a-bag. There is a removable inner \"pod\", which I found very hard to remove and replace - but it does render good protection. The inside comes with four moveable dividers that are \"origami inspired\", which means that they have a lot of folds so they can be reshaped. I found that they do a good job of dividing the case, but the round shape makes them somewhat less useful. There is plenty of room for my Nikon camera with the extended lens, and the power pack to recharge the batteries. In the top flap one will find an additional zippered compartment for flash cards and small items. Finally, there is a large slot (between the \"pod\" and the outer shell), that can contain an IPad or Android pad up to about 10 inches. Both the inner \"pod\" and the outer shell feature a handle. There is just one shoulder strap for carrying the outer shell.The inner dimensions are 9.4 X 5.9 X 8.7 inches. External size is 12.2 X 13 X 6.3 (but it sure seems larger).There are several things I like: The construction is very sturdy, with good material and stitching, and it will provide excellent protection. The divider system is a bit clumsy, but works well enough. The adjustable shoulder strap is comfortable. The handle is good for carrying. The outer zipper pocket is large enough for keys and other loose items.But there are some drawbacks to the design. I could not find a way to make it simple to use; the bag is so bulky that I keep hitting it with my arm. I think that the size is just a bit too large - it needs to be a backpack at this size. The compression straps can be loosened to make the bag somewhat larger, but in practice that doesn't make much difference - the inner \"pod\" doesn't expand. The \"origami\" dividers have a lot of velcro, and I found it somewhat inconvenient to reshape them - it takes some effort. And last, that inner \"pod\" is too difficult to remove and reinstall - so I won't be using it separately.Summary: A bit bulky, but good protection. I consider this a \"niche\" bag, that some people will like, but many will not. Only moderately recommended if you have to carry a couple of lenses and cannot use a more convenient sized bag.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Odd, Bulky Design", "unixReviewTime": 1400544000, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2014"}

So I find myself traveling with all of my camera gear packed into my Thinktank rolling bag and always have liked to have a small fast camera to use in case I saw something I wanted to shoot. Be it something that just peaked my interest or even if I was on a flight where the flight attendant decided to strip naked, swig a bottle of champagne, and then deploy the emergency shoot and run away (no that has not really happened on any flights I've been on, but, you know, it could).I wanted to be able to make a picture of something if I needed/wanted to without having to drag my roller out of the overhead and pull a camera out or feeling like the image quality would suffer because of the compromise of having a smaller point and shoot camera. But every other P/S camera I have used over the years left me feeling just that way... it was an image quality compromise either because the sensor was not very good or because the lens was slow, or the camera was painfully laggy.So I usually ended up carrying one of my Canon 5d mkIII bodies over my shoulder with the 24-70 on it... which is also not an ideal solution because you have to take it through security and try to keep it from swinging around while carrying bags, etc... then you have to find somewhere to put it once you get on your flight.Then I saw this camera... and fell in love with it. The image quality is amazing. It has a sharp and fast Zeiss lens 24-70 f1.8-2.8, fast and accurate autofocus, great fps rate (if you need it), and absolutely knockout image quality.
