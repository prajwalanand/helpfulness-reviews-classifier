I have extensively tested it out. This is a well made lens with a nice feel to it. It has a wonderful review on Photozone and by reviewers on Amazon. It takes excellent pictures on both crop & full frame camera bodies.However I found close focusing, macro photography,  literally impossible unless a tripod was used. A monopod improved focusing but it was still not tack sharp. I found the 100mm focal length, actually 160mm on a 1.6 T3i crop body, to be difficult to hold steady without a monopod. The autofocus also gave me a lot of problems indoors. The lens focusing just seems to jam in low light situations. It gets stuck and the only way to release it is to point it long distance. This has happened on several occasions and really is very annoying.Like i said before, this lens has great reviews on Photozone, and other professional photographic sites, but it is just not working for me. My (EF 70-300 f/4-5.6 -\"IS\" lens)  is slightly heavier but it took better indoor and outdoor pictures than this EF 100mm Macro 2.8. I could not believe it when I compared the pictures.Will test it out a little longer for macro purposes. If things do not improve I will be returning it to Amazon as being defective due to autofocus jamming. Just a real diappointment.  It is possible that mine might be just a bad copy or maybe the autofocus technology is still lagging in this area of photography?Update: 7/21/12 -  After nearly 2 weeks of using this lens I decided to return it as I just could not tolerate the jamming on autofocus and lack of IS.It is however a well built and excellent lens for those who love spending hours doing macro work with a tripod and manual focusing. Autofocus however needs to vastly be improved in this area of photography.I gave it a 3 because I find autofocus for MACRO SHOOTING useless.

I just couldn't turn off the Yamaha that these are attached to because I am amazed at what a difference these speakers have made to my listening experiance! I installed two of these as my rear/back 7.1 speakers. My living room is open to the kitchen/breakfast area so it's a large room. We watch movies in there, total room size is about 15'X30'. I know there is still a 'burn-in' period I have to go through, but I can already tell a huge difference.Before I go on and on about how great these sound, be sure you cut out the drywall with at least a 1\" clearance beyond the template that is included. I had to install these over some cabinets horizontally and actually had a hard time locking them in place. This is my fault not a problem with the speakers. I guess I could have gone with the 6.5\" instead but wanted the lower frequency range. Yes the Sub takes over at 80Hz but...yeah.The speakers have excellent highs and lows, went through various genres and all sound great, I was really looking to get more mids and lows from the rear speakers. When we are in the kitchen we turn on the 7.1 stereo for music on the Yamaha RX-671 (also amazing!) and wanted better sound in the rear part of the room. The smaller yamaha 2.5\" speakers were way too small, while we had good highs, it sounded like I had headphone speakers for my rear/back. Now with the Polk, the sound is full and rich. The vocals have that mid bass sound so it sounds real and not like a speaker.Don't hesitate to get these, they are worth every penny. Easy to install and sound great! I really wish I could provide a sample of what my room sounds like now and I know you'd buy these without a second thought!Receiver Yamaha RX-V671Center Polk CS20 (Large but amazing!)Front Sony SS-F6000sSides Yamaha NS-AP6500M (old HTIB) I know I need to replace these!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wow!

Given the right lighting, it works decently as a portrait lens due to the smooth bokeh the 9-blade aperture allows. It was a nice lens to bring to the zoo with me, although the slow AF resulted in several missed shots. Compared to some of my older third-party lenses (the Vivitar Series 1 from the 80's for example) this lens has a little less quality optically, but honestly I didn't think there was much difference between this, and Canon's budget zoom in this price range.If you don't own a zoom lens and are just starting out, this is definitely a good choice. It serves a good purpose in my camera bag if I ever need to go out and shoot without worrying about equipment safety, and so I would also recommend it for that purpose.

I have always been a hype when i get my speakers so i like to play them loud right away, this time i waited and broke them in properly. i already have a DV62CLR so it matched perfectly well with these babies. For stereo music, these speakers create an enormous sound field that envelopes you.For Dolby/DTS they make you proud every single time.

Now that I have everything working and can play music to these from a digital source I am very happy. It turned out that the underwhelming sound was from the limits of the music source and not these speakers.I'm not going to pretend to be some audio expert. The fact also is that like beauty, sound is a very personal as well. That said I'm very happy with the sound of these and also surprised at the strength at the bottom end. 6x8s have never been a first choice size for me as even though they are only 1 inch smaller than a 6x9 they are made to fit in a much more compact area. I wasn't expecting much bottom end and was pleasantly surprised by what I heard. These also seem to pretty strong in the mid range and for some maybe a little too strong. For me though it compliments my front speakers pretty well as those seem to be a little lacking in the mids.I have these installed in the rear of my 1996 F250 extended cab. It should be noted that I needed to use a spacer to fit them in there as the magnet was hitting the sheet metal at the back of the speaker opening. Even with the spacer it is very tight. This is one reason why 6x8's are made so compact. Keep this in mind if you also have a limited space behind the speaker opening. Also, the volume behind the speaker is likely less than ideal so these may work even better in other installations.The setup I'm running is a Kenwood KDC-BT652U head unit, Vifa 6.25\" coax in the front doors driven by the Kenwood, these Pioneers in the rear driven by an old Alpine amp.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm very happy with these speakers", "unixReviewTime": 1350518400, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2012"}

This lens is considered as one of the best lenses Canon makes and its optics and build quality justify the claim. After you have scrutinized the pictures taken with the rented lens, think if you are ready to spend $1500 on a lens that might outlive you.  Here are some pointers to help you make the decision.There are two principal reasons you should consider this lens for -1)Amazing sharpness: The images are razor sharp. It is so sharp at its best(lets say f/5.6) that even Photoshop cannot improve the sharpness.2)Photography without flash: Lets say you have a poorly lit or an almost dark subject which you want to shoot without flash. Do not worry! Put the aperture to f/1.4 and voila! You got yourself a photograph where the subject appears perfectly illuminated . If you cannot trust your eyes for focusing (oh wait! You cannot even see the subject clearly in the dark!) use \"Auto focus\". Auto focus of this lens is very smooth and the USM is terrific.In my view, there are two additional but less pressing reasons to own this lens -1)Focal length- I use a crop sensor, and the 35mm becomes equivalent to 56mm which is a very fitting focal length for general purpose photography. Ranging from close-up, portraits to landscape everything can be covered by it.2) The bokeh it produces is very smooth and buttery.I have not mentioned the contrast and the color saturation because the suffix \"L\" gives away that secret.Is there a reason for which you should think twice before purchasing it ?YES!1)This lens produces chromatic aberrations at higher apertures. In case of back-lit subjects it sometimes produces chromatic aberrations even at f/5.6. Initially I thought I got a bad copy but I later confirmed that chroma aberration is a problem with this lens.2)Some copies seem to backfocus. Among the two copies of this lens I tested, one back-focused at f/1.4. However, some Canon cameras do have an in-built focus adjustment mechanism (micro-adjustment). If you own one of them (7D, 5D and 1D), you can buy any copy of this lens and adjust the focus if needed.Having said all these, I think I will buy this lens again if I have to, because nothing else beats all of its pluses, whereas the close competitors share or even exceed its negatives. Please keep in mind that this lens or any other prime or zoom lens for that matter, is not perfect. It is extremely hard to design a great lens and best lenses are often custom-manufactured by lens designers, and are priced well over $1500.Let me know if you need any information and I will be happy to share my experience of this lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Almost a perfect prime", "unixReviewTime": 1331856000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2012"}

My issues have been this is ISO 100 for a camera that uses ISO 75.  On my particular Polaroid despite being a faster ISO at default values my shots appear slightly under exposed.  This is easily fixed by leaving the \"light/darken\" setting always at a lighter value than normal, but I don't know if it's a quirk with my camera of the film.A few tips if you've never used this type of cartridge before:Clean the rollers after every use, chemical goop gets on it and can both gum it up and also keeps it from being a smooth surface to press out the developer.When you load it there should be a black paper tab sticking out with several white tabs beneath it. Pull out the black tab carefully and smoothly--it is prone to tearing but long as you pull the whole thing out you're okay.A white tab with a number on it is left--this also tells you what shot number you're on. After you take your shot pull on this hard until it tears off.  Done right the actual film unit itself will be sticking out just above it and can be pulled out in a smooth stroke.  I originally thought the tab pulled it out all at once and ended up ruining a pack trying to figure it out.If the camera double feeds or jams, open the back and check the roller carrier.  There's a metal wire loop that is supposed to latch into a hook on the camera back.  If it's come loose it's not tensioning properly.That's about it; the price is very reasonable even compared to 35mm as you don't need to develop the shots, and you get a long lasting glossy print.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An excellent replacement film", "unixReviewTime": 1333238400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2012"}

I have always used a tripod bag to keep my tripods fresh looking and to carry that way. I am now using a Gitzo tripod with a Gitzo pan head. I have mixed feelings about the shape of this bag. I have to fold down my pan head just so with the long arm facing downwards to fit into the bag. It is a very tight fit up on the top part of the bag so I have to then figure out how to turn the tripod as it is inserted into the case so that I can close the zipper properly. I would have liked a straight shape instead of all of that but Helix did not have any at the time I needed one. The zipper is strong, nice material but too cumbersome to insert the tripod with pan head. Also, no pockets anywhere on the bag nor in the bag. Pockets are great for small accessories. Ball head users will probably have an easier time loading the tripod into the bag and then hurrying along with the strap over their shoulder.As an update, having read all of the reviews here at this time, I will say that photographers seem to miss the \"no pockets\". The bag does have quality and quality costs money. The zipper has held up for me. The bag has not torn. Yes, the carry strap, for over the shoulder use, is a bit short.

I've been trying them out for a few days now and I'm really on the fence about returning them and finding something better, or keeping them.My impressions so far:These are NOT high quality from an audio point of view.  But no $50 pair of headphones is going to be.  I'd say the audio quality on these is a bit less than the Audio-Technica's I bought previously.  For my purposes, which is 99% listening to podcasts/internet radio while falling asleep and the occasional listening to same, or music, while puttering around the house, the sound is adequate.The &#34;hiss&#34; isn't bad once you dial in the sweet spot on the signal.  I've never had a a pair of the really expensive wireless 'phones, so I don't know how much better you can do.The major reason I'm considering returning is the fit.  They're just barely &#34;OK&#34; in that department.  They sit very loosely on the head and if they are pushed or knocked even slightly they'll slide off.  The Audio-Technica's are considerably better in this department.I wish someone made a set of RF (radio frequency) ear buds of decent quality--I think those would be ideal for listening in bed.

R \"Value Consumer\"", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "I purchased these for use on an Alaskan cruise where the weather is notoriously damp (rain, fog), so being waterproof was a must. I considered the Bushnell H2O for about $40 cheaper, but since I was extremely happy with my small 10x25 Nikon binoculars I decided to spring for these. Boy am I glad I did. First, be aware that these are fairly heavy, especially if you are used to the more compact models. They seem to be at least twice as heavy as the three sets of compact binoculars I have, including Nikon, Pentax and Alpen. Part of this is certainly because of the much larger objective lens and rubberized shell needed for waterproofing, but the Action EX Extreme's use a completely metal internal structure that also adds weight (but makes them much more durable). The binoculars come with a very nice, wide neck strap, individual cups for the objective lenses, and a double cup for the eye pieces. Each of these parts also has a slot on the side so you can hang them from your strap when not in use. Nice touch. The case is also large and sturdy, unlike the canvas-like case you often get with cheaper binoculars (like the Alpens I have)Now to performance. I'm fairly certain these binoculars use porro prisms and not roof prisms as stated in the description. You can generally tell by the offset of the eyepiece and the objective lens. The eye relief on these binoculars is more than adequate, and while I had a larger field of view without my glasses, they worked perfectly fine with them. The binoculars were extremely easy to focus, and with the 40mm objective lens let in lots of light and provide a greater than 400ft field of view at 1000m. Everything fit snugly and workmanship on the product appears to be very high. The eye cups all fit well, and there is very low risk of them just falling off. The focus wheel is firm but moves smoothly. Just perfect in my mind.  I absolutely would not hesitate to buy these again or recommend them to anyone. Right now I have 4 sets of \"good\" binoculars and several cheap ones that I wouldn't mind being dropped overboard (decent for a 10yo though). Unless I'm traveling super light/small, these are going to be my \"go to\" binoculars.

Erb", "helpful": [34, 39], "reviewText": "I've been looking for a decent quality projection screen to use with my newly purchased LCD projector. Unfortunately, this is not a quality projection screen, It is a flimsy, made in China screen. It's cheap and if you require a screen for infrequent use, then this may do the trick for you. I've actually returned mine due to many issues that I discuss in my review.If you're not familiar with all the different sized screens out there you might be a little confused by what size screen to get. It's not that difficult to sort out but you need to consider a few factors before you can choose the most appropriate screen. First you must consider how far away you're going to have your LCD projector from the screen. The further away the projector is, the larger your screen will need to be. My projector is best when it's about 6-8 feet  from the screen.Next you must get a screen that is of a similar aspect ratio of your projector. In my case, I have a projector that has a resolution equal to a 4:3 aspect ratio. This is not HD resolution. If you have a HD resolution projector, you'll optimally want a projector that is wider than the height of the screen which can be either 16:9 or 16:10. There are also screens that are 1:1 aspect ratio (height and width are the same). Of course you can use any screen size for any projector, but you'll have un-used screen areas with a mis-matched screen and you won't be able to achieve the largest image on the screen if you don't have the right aspect ratio.The 84\" screen is perfect match for my projector. The screen has good reflectivity and is washable.The tripod legs are a quite a bit wobbly when setting up the screen and they do not have a locking feature at all.  There are two adjustments possible on the screen itself as you're setting it up: the top height of the screen, which is adjusted by loosening/tightening a cylindrical plastic adjuster on the vertical tubing. And the bottom height of the screen which is achieved by unlatching a relatively flimsy looking lever right above the handle. Once you set the height of the top, you then adjust the height of the bottom of the screen.One feature I appreciate about the screen is that you can snug the screen right up close to a wall if you wish by rotating the screen/handle once it's been opened. That enables you to either have the screen almost flush against a wall or have the rear leg pointing straight behind the screen and having minimal leg in front of the screen to make it less likely someone will trip on the extended legs. The stand also has a keystone adjustment which could be useful if your projector is unable to adequately correct for that.Realistically I think this screen is about as good as it could be for the price, which is to say, not that good at all. If you're looking for a more robust, better made screen you'll end up spending quite a bit more. In my case, I paid about 70 bucks more for a Da-Lite screen which is made in the USA in Indiana. For frequent use, that extra money may be well spent.A serious issue I have with the screen other than the flimsy lever is the fact that my screen had an appreciable series of horizontal, full-width ridges caused by the wrapping of the screen around the case cylinder. You can imagine that as the first edge of the screen is inserted into the cylinder that each subsequent wrap of the screen around the cylinder will have a slight bump as it goes over that insertion point. This is causing increasingly wider lines from bottom to the top of the screen as can be seen in the photo I uplodad in the user photos area.I've called Elite Screens about this and they claim those lines will go away after the screen has been left open for several days. That has not been my experience however. My screen has been open for over a week now and the lines have not diminished at all. And the 2-year warranty that sounds good on paper is not all that great when you take into consideration that the customer must bear the brunt of paying return shipping to Elite Screens. That is not acceptable. Why should the customer have to pay to return something that is defective? In fact, I've returned the screen to Amazon and Amazon has provided a UPS shipping label at no cost, something that would not have happened with Elite Screens directly.Once again, Amazon has pulled through, even better than the actual company that manufactures the screen!The screen seems a great value but the flimsy construction and poor return policy make it not nearly as good a deal as you think. The screen is made in China and is cheap and flimsy. A much better alternative, and what I've just received to replace the Elite Screen I'm returning is the Da-Lite84IN Picture King 50X67 Matte Wht 4:3 Video Tripod Screen. It is USA made and is much heavier duty, locking tripod legs that can be operated with your foot, and a much more substantial screen locking mechanism.

I must be an idiot because I can't figure out what setting to use on my camera.  I assumed auto setting on point and shoot cameras would work, but it seems like too much or not enough light comes in.  And it's hard to tell if there is vignetting when taking a picture of stars since the sky is black.  Also it is a bit tricky to see what I am taking a picture of because as I mentioned before the exposure doesn't seem right and all I seem to see in the display is blackness.  When weather clears up I'll try taking a picture of the moon.  I actually think these are primarily for lunar photography.  I doubt I'll ever get a clear image of the Pleiades or Orion's Belt.It's also a bit tricky to mount bigger point and shoot cameras.  I have a Sony H20/b and it barely fits, Can't really zoom the lens in and a Canon G11 fits alright, but again I don't think I have full range of the optical zoom.I have a like a 4&#34; Meade and a 9&#34; Celestron Schmidt Cassegrain  You have to make sure your scope is heavy enough with a strong Y axis so the weight of the mount and camera don't make the telescope rock upwards like a seesaw.I like the idea, but the execution just isn't there for novices in astronomy and limited photography skills.  I think if you are really interested in astrophotography to look into a webcam, and using some free software that will take video and compound several layers of still images from video composing some pretty detailed astro photographs.

I work intimately with home theater and audio mixing/mastering - so I have some pretty good gear.  The key to being happy with any audio gear is expectation management.  You have to have low expectations for gear (based on price) to truly be happy.Back in 2009, a friend gave me a pair of these as a gift.  I kept them all this time, constantly thinking about selling them or making something with them (not in my car).  I recently bought a 2012 Mitsubishi Lancer ES with the 6-speaker system - and while I love the car, those factory speakers were awful.I put these in the front doors using the included crossovers.  I also put 60sqft of Peel & Seal from Lowes into the doors to deaden up the road noise.  I installed theHifonics Zeus ZXI63 6.5-Inch 3-Way Speakersin the rear doors.Only powered by the factory head unit, these really aren't that bad.  They're a huge improvement over the factory thin paper woofers (rated at 15W).  I can turn the stereo all the way up and have no distortion in the speakers.  These speakers are only slightly more efficient than the factory units, however (sound volume per watt).The real win here is range at higher volumes.  The dynamic range of these speakers is much much better than the factory units.  The added highs and lows make a vast improvement in perceived quality.I plan to add a 4ch amp to this kit.  I've already purchased theRockford Fosgate PBR300X4 Punch BRT 300 Watt Ultra Compact 4 Channel Amplifierand a wiring kit (8AWG).  I'm hoping to get more of a performance gain once the unit is installed.  I chose all of this equipment to keep my install \"stealth\" - I don't want anyone to be able to see that I have better audio gear installed, just hear it.I may add a sub in the future, but with the doors deadened up, the bass response is much tighter and I don't think I'll need it.  My car is a lease, so the less alterations I do the better.  Feel free to ask any questions.For ~$250 you can get all of the speakers and the 4ch amp I mentioned above.  For ~$100 you can get enough material to deaden all of your doors.

This remote is 1/4 of the price, so I didn't expect the world. But I'm actually reasonably surprised. Everything works as it should. All the features I need and use are there. Setup isn't as easy as with a Harmony, but it's not terrible either. A CD is included, but it's essentially the owners manual in video form. No setup software or anything like Harmony. But, using the users manual and a little time and you'll have it down pat. After an attempt or two, I can now program a huge macro without even opening the manual. Pretty easy once you understand how it works.***I haven't gotten the RF20 to work with the Logitech Harmony PS3 IR-Bluetooth adapter. If anyone has gotten this combo to work, please comment on this review and let me know how :-) ***The first thing I liked was the build quality. Those that have owned a Harmony know what I'm talking about. These buttons feel solid, don't rock back and forth in their positions, etc. It's just all around well built. Like it should be. (And actually better than the $300+ Harmony I had even when it was new) I also like that there's some space between the buttons. That's also something else the Harmony didn't have.This remote has only 5 multi-function buttons surrounding the screen. My old Harmony had 8. That is a little drawback. You do use those buttons quite a bit, so I'd like to see more there. But you can page over and get 5 more selections. Just an extra button press each time. My biggest complaint is really just the lack of fine customization. The Harmony allowed me to attach any function for any device to any button. The RF20 allows you to rename each function, but you can't actually move a function, say, from the 3rd page to the 1st page of features. The functions for my cable box, for example, has two functions on the 1st page that are just labeled \">>I\" and \"&lt;&lt;I\" which don't seem to do anything, but yet the RECORD button is stuck back on page 3. I'd like to move the RECORD feature to page one for quick access but that doesn't seem to be possible. Meh. Guess I'll just put up with it. No huge deal.Again, I'm slightly spoiled by a full-featured Harmony, but the build quality of the RF20 is much better and, most importantly, it's 1/4 of the price.

The flimsy vinyl drawstring bag that comes with it offers very little real protection. It scratches and marks up so easily, even with normal, careful use. The first T-mount had no locktite on the screws or no screws at all. This allowed the inner ring to rotate, making it unusable. A call to 47th St. photo had a replacement T-mount on its way which arrived very quickly. The forward set screws on the lens itself weren't locktited in causing the lens to become loose with a severe wobble. Not wanting to go through the hassle of returning the lens I tightened the screws and applied a spot of Elmer's Glue All into each thread hole on top of the screws. So far, that's holding. As for the large lens cap, it looks like someone just grabbed any cap they thought might fit. It constantly pops off from being too small.Second, the positive issues: The lens is a MUCH sharper than my Phoenix 500mm catadioptric mirror lens. This all lens-lens also has f-stops down to f-32 to control the very shallow depth of field inherent in any 500mm lens.

I was worried about the fit of the new fan, which was not a problem, because the size, case and blade shape, and mounting holes' positions of the Skythe fan were identical to the fan I was replacing.However, I made an incorrect assumption that all 40mm x 40mm x 10mm fans would be absolutely the same, which is NOT the case. The differences are in RPM and CFM. Skythe fan is very quiet, but it also runs at 60% RPM (3500 vs. 6000) and pushes 64% CFM (4.1 vs. 6.4) of the original fan. I discovered this after I installed Skythe fan and could not tell whether it was running because it was not making any noise and the airflow out of the vent was practically undetectable. The JVC stereo turns the fan on and off as needed, and it was not running when I soldered it on. I had to put the case back together and play a CD twice and then take the case apart while the stereo was plugged in to see whether the fan was indeed running.  It was, but very little air was being pushed by it.I am going to replace it with a fan with specs that are closer to the original fan's specs. I was looking at the Link Depot's ball bearing 40mm x 10mm fan, but several users on newegg complained about the noise, so I have purchased a sleeve bearing ARX Ceradyne-A FD1240-A2012A from xsfans.Overall, I think this is a good quiet fan, but make sure it suits your needs.

Or, a photo of the entire sky-scraper as you stand at its front door?  Need a lens that can handle large group photos that will fit everyone it?  A lens that will add weird (almost fisheye) perspective from a portraiture perspective?  Look no further, this is your lens.It was pretty important to me that this lens have the wider f/2.8 vs. the 17-40mm f/4.0 aperture (which retails for about half the price).  I will confirm with the professional and amateur reviews that this lens has distortion and vignetting in the corners at wide apertures (f/2.8) for 16mm to about 20mm.  But actually, for me it gives those photos a bit of charm - see this lens's interesting perspective in my photo of my sister-in-law's cats.  I've added a circular polarizing filter to this thing (albeit expensive given the monstrous 82mm lens width) and in the 20-30mm range, the quality and clarity is quite insane, my copy is razor sharp and makes for an awesome landscape lens particularly when using mirror lock-up and affixed to a tripod.  This lens is way too short for a standard portrait lens and you'd be surprised how close you'd have to get to someone for them to take up a significant portion of their mug in the frame - your subject might object to your proximity.  This might stand in however, as a specialized walk-about lens particularly if you're in a sprawling downtown neighborhood with looming skyscrapers or mountainous backdrops.Build quality is superb.  One small gripe is that we, consumers need to add some type of filter to the lens to finish its weather proofing.  For this much cash, that should already be taken care of by Canon.  But given I always protect my glass, a filter goes on anyway so I guess it's really not a a huge issue but I wanted to make sure everyone is in the know.This is the best zoom ultra-wide angle lens out there for Canon.  It's the best, but is available at a hefty ransom and only you can decide whether the price-performance ratio makes sense to you.  It has a reasonably wide aperture (f/2.8) with a good range of focal length (16-35) - but just keep in mind about the distortion and pincushion effects at the wide and zoomed-in focal lengths respectively.Otherwise, I really like this lens.

It works as any other transmitter, it dampens radio noise, and allows you to use the frequency for your own purposes.  It's good at that.  But it struggles with the input from my ipod.  Simply touching the jack will give you loud pops and grinding.  If my ipod is turned to high, the noise coming to my stereo will be garbled and nasty.  If I turn it too low, I get an unacceptable amount of static from normal FM noise.  At medium levels, I'll max out the volume on my radio dial and still not get a satisfactory volume. additionally, songs from my ipod come out murky, and lack the clarity I enjoy in my selection.But the final straw came a few days ago when my car was filled with a horrible stench.  Soon afterward the coby CA-745 died.

The front clear plastic view window is slightly loose so contact with the scroll wheel is sometimes devoid, causing the frustration of having to stop what your doing and attend to it more closely.

Learned later about the variable rpms and decreased performance of Caviar Green HDDs. Not 100% 7200 RPM. Keeping it quieter, cooler and more energy efficient, which I liked in the beginning, but would have bought a performance based HDD had I known. Main use for the drive was to use with my WD Live TVs in different rooms on different flat screen displays. All of my music, photos and DVD/Bluray/home video content was shared between this drive and others.This was my go-to drive. Took this drive with me on vacations all around the world. Ski trips. Road trips. To work. I dropped it, knocked it over while on the desk, and probably a few other not-so-awesome incidents for a HDD. It lived, and survived for several years. I loved it. It died. Taking hours of home footage of my daughter, surfing, and other activities, plus HD movies and hundreds of GB's of multimedia content. Did I have back-ups of the family stuff? Darn right! Multimedia.... ... ...some of it on other HDDs. Not all was lost, mainly a great deal of time spent converting DVD TS/VOB files to joint .mp4, divx, .avi or the like. For years this device would pair seamlessly with my WD HDTV/live and my family could eliminate the need for DVD/Bluray players. Knew I should have had a mirror drive. Fail.Originally used this HDD with my PC by way of the sata port. Worked well and transferred files moderately fast. With XP the sata port had a patchy relationship. Did my computer recognize it 100% of the time, no. Did I have to plug and play it a few times on several occasions to get it to finally be recognized? Yes! Was it my motherboard/computer? Never hooked it up via Sata to other people's computers....So, possibly. It worked every time with firewire 400. That seemed to be the go to port. All ports worked great; will only say that after years of use the USB port became loose and didn't seem to align perfectly in the case. Made it work. Still worked, but wasn't a secure, sturdy fit and sometimes the USB cable would detach if slightly bumped the wrong way. A hassle at times.Once the clicking began, my frustration and utter resentment towards WD grew, mainly towards its Caviar Green series of HDDs. Seems that there are just a slew of people with complaints and mishaps with these Caviar Green HDDs...but then again, you look at any HDD and one will find reviews about issues they have encountered. But there are countless you tube videos, how-to's, data recovery, freeze it this way and that infos all over the web about these drives. Use that as a main decider for which HDD you choose. Affected my choice in the end. Literally looked for a list of WDD drives that had Caviar green inside and stayed away.Would I buy this HDD again. Hard to say. First instinct yes, because I have so many memories with it. Lame I know. But true. Relied on it. Grew to really like it. Then the Caviar Green HDD said F*** you, I'm tired, and I am taking a nice long nap.My other, older, 500GB WD My Book Essential HDD is still alive and kicking, and luckily, not clicking. Have only good things to say about it. So knock on wood..keep on keeping on champ!Just ordered 2 new 3TB Seagate HDDs this evening, and if that wasn't good enough, plugged in the old WD 1TB earlier today, for the first time in months, to have it, just as I remembered, begin its clicking away. So I laughed, hit it a few times with the blunt end of a pair of scissors (case opened and removed, hard drive exposed naturally), cursed at it some more, did my information-rain-dance, and went about my HDD research. Other brands, no doubt. Serves you right WD.After a good 10-15 minutes of HDD clicking the shortcut appeared on my desktop. Amazed I opened it to see what files remained. Most, if not all, but many corrupt were able to be seen, but being formatted in NTFS, was all that could be done with them. Went and downloaded NTFS for Mac, a program that would let me access NTFS drives from a Mac, and was informed I had to... ...RESTART! Would my drive be recognized again? ...was this the last time I would ever see the files I once had? Should I restart? After the restart it was backto the same old nothing. So, I did what any technician- who could give a rats a$$ about his job would do- and began, shaking it, banging it and hitting it with whatever I could find, pressing on both sides of the HDD until I heard grinding on the inside, and surprisingly the HDD came back to life, I got movies, music and other valuable information off, and it has been a happy ending to what was, months ago, a devastating blow, what felt like getting kicked in the gut, losing so much information.Note: Have another old 500GB Maxtor 3200, and 500GB Seagate Free Agent that have both been great. If you need a small pocket HDD, check out the Seagate FreeAgent Go 500GB. Lightweight, quiet, and does what it needs to. WD. Listen to your customers and read the reviews. Build us a product we can trust and rely on and we, your customers will be loyal to you. Look at Apple. Three word business model: Simple, reliable, service!

No doubt the thirst-suffering keyboard-slave inventors of this little item thought they had an instant winner on their hands, but they were done in by cheap materials and science.The science problem is worth dwelling upon; the sad truth is that hot plates will ALWAYS work MUCH better than cooling plates for a reason in addition to the fact that hot plates can make use of the waste heat from electrical resistance (either directly or as a byproduct of the Peltier effect) while cooling plates must dissipate it:convection.Hotter fluids rise and colder fluids fall, thus a container of any liquid placed upon a hot plate will quickly become uniformly heated while a similar container of liquid placed upon a cooling plate will get as cold as it is ever going to get at the bottom while the upper layers won't cool much at all.  That's why the instructions for this item say to use 8 ounce soda pop cans even though the product was obviously originally designed for 12 ounce soda pop cans; doing so removes what will always be the warmest 1/3rd of a 12 ounce soda pop can.It is no accident in my opinion that later (?) models of this productPortable USB Cooler and Warmer 2-in-1come with a switch so it can be used as a hot plate as well, which function can at least be presumed to work.There ARE ways to fight this, but doing so would require spending more on materials.  aries2110, one of the top reviewers of this version of the product shows what might have been by installing a stronger fan (for dissipating waste heat) and taping some insulation to the inside, reporting a significant increase in cooling.  The less handy can try setting it in front of a desk fan and putting acan insulatorupside down on the can.  I also noted some additional cooling but nothing approaching \"refrigerator cold\".Basically, about all it is good for IMHO is SLOWING the warming up of a previously refrigerated can of soda pop more than just setting it on your desk will.

The advertising says 20 mile range but that's obviously under optimal conditions and optimal conditions being absolutely flat ground with zero obstructions between you and the other radio. In the real world, it'll get about 1.5 miles urban and depending on how heavily wooded a forest is, around 3 miles for forests (camping, etc.). The radio has a built in LED flashlight which isn't all that bright but comes in real handy when you need it. The stock rechargeable batteries aren't too great so I tend to use (3) AA batteries instead which proves to be much better in terms of performance and battery life. The belt clips broke on me and was a $7 replacement excluding tax and shipping which is ridiculous but it was a necessity for me so I was willing. The volume control knob is smooth but maybe a little too smooth. I often find myself constantly checking to see what the volume level is because moving around with the radio hooked onto my belt or pocket would sometimes rotate the volume knob. Not a big deal, though as it rarely ever happens. The only major issue I've had with this radio is that if I press the PTT button and then let go of the button at the end of my transmission, the radio would suddenly shut down and then I would have to manually rotate the knob to the OFF setting and then turn it back ON. I'm not entirely sure why this happens but it's most likely because of low battery power even though the battery level indicator might say otherwise. After replacing the batteries, the problem seems to go away. And if anyone was wondering about longevity, I've had these since September of 2009 and have rigorously used it even up until today. They are still working perfectly fine although there is some clear degrading in transmit/receive quality but don't mind that because I've used these way more than anyone would ever get close to using.

Ryan \"Uber Book Nerd\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "There are quite  a few reviews here that will give a perspective buyer a feel for the Pros/Cons of this product so I'll keep it short.We have a moderate sized home and have great connectivity in most of the home, but very bad connectivity in the kitchen, office and living room. While we typically have 4  bars in most of the house, we usually have 1 bar at best in the kitchen and it's not unusual to have no coverage. Even when we do , calls drop all the time and it's very annoying.  We took a gamble and bought the Wilson.Setup was a Pain in the butt, that's my big knock on this thing. In our case (and from what I understand) you'll typically have to have it installed outside to get much value for it.  We have really thick tree coverage in the back yard and each direction pointing to the nearest Cell Tower. In fact, if you are standing in the backyard, front yard or sides, you can not see the tower at all.  we didn't' have Rabbit ears so had nothing to really attach to on the high part of the roof that would give us line of sight.  To get it working correctly, we ended up cutting a small swatch of foliage in the back yard so we could get clear LOS to the tower. We ended up mounting it to the back part of the roof on the lower side (basically, top part of 1st floor roof).  It took about 45 minutes to tweaking to get both green lights on which isn't unreasonable - however after about 20 minutes you really start wondering if you're going to be able to make it work. Even after 30 mins, we still couldn't get both greens on. Frustrated I decided to get the swath cut out in the back which ended up doing the trick. Outside of that, we had to drill a hole through the wall to feed the cable. our choices were to drill it in the roof and drop the cable through the wall, then run it into a connector , or basically drill a hole outside right next to the one that the cable company drilled for our cable (not saying it had to be next to the cable co's hole, just that it was proximate and that just happened to be a place with no wires and easily drilled through).For a handyman that has a decent set of tools, the install is no big deal. However for many people, drilling a whole through the wall, drilling holes on the roof to add a mounting bracket etc is a bit much. We were lucky in that we had one handyman that does work for us that could do it all.  If we  had to use the indoor mount or rig something outside, it would have been a deal breaker (inside b/c we couldn't get any connectivity worth talking about, outside b/c the cable needs to connect the antenna to the signal module).On the upside, as soon as we got the green lights, ALL OF OUR CELL CONNECTIVITY problems disappeared immediately. Various family members have a few different phones, 4g, 3g's and a cheapo pay as you go emergency phone which I'm not sure about. The 4g  phone now has full bars everywhere in the house all the time. The ones I know to be 3g is pretty much the same.. it occasionally goes down by one bar, but it's still 3 bars and no calls have dropped. On the cheapo phone, there have been no connectivity problems and no drops.  It's also worth noting that since we got it installed, we've had some really harsh weather.  There's been cloud coverage that completely kills our XM stereos and our neighbors dish network yet we've had no problems at all. B/c of that, b/c it does what it's advertised to do and does it really well, I'm very pleased with it. We've been fighting connectivity issues for a few years now and had always heard too much negative stuff about boosters to really give them a try.  By now we heard enough good (including Amazon reviews) that I figured it was worth the risk and i'm very glad we go it.  My parents live on an island on the coast of SC with really horrendously bad coverage and we ordered them a unit which I'll post back about once it's installed. My guess though is that it'll help.The key seems to be that you need to have at least a week signal to begin with, so if you have no signal, I really can't speak to it. However we had one bar at best for most of the house and the problem was completely resolved.  The wife and i both work from home frequently and the daughter is a 13 year old who constantly talks to friends.  we haven't had a single call drop since this was added, and I think we've had a chance to really test it adequately since we use our cell phones for work meetings (and daughter talks frequently to other friends). Dropped calls are such a completely pain in the butt so the elimination of drops alone justifies the price. the fact we don't have to constantly say \"Are you still there, can you hear me\" over and over is just icing on the cake. It's a good unit, I'm very glad I bought it, bought one for the parents b/c I'm quite sure it'll fix their problem and would gladly buy another one.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Definitely worth the price", "unixReviewTime": 1342656000, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2012"}

I wanted something that I could use with 110 or 220 and plug in multiple items. Most power strips sold in the US only work with 110 and not 220. I have written several manufacturers of so called \"travel\" power strips to ask if they would work with 220 and almost all replied with a firm \"NO\". However outlets-to-go replied \"yes\" their power strip will work with 110 or 220. On that I purchased this through amazon and i have not regretted the choice.First, it is compact and easily fits into my suitcase. In fact, I stuff it into a shoe with my plug adapter. The pig-tail cord folds around the unit and stows by plugging it in to itself. The pig-tail is nice to have because at some hotels the plug is stuffed behind a desk with some kind of bar running in front (what were they thinking?). There are three plugs that are well spaced. two on one side and a single plug on the other. This is nice because some computers or cell chargers take up a lot of space. The USB outlet is a nice touch. It charges my cell phone, my MP3, and my sanyo battery charger with no problems. Since I don't own an I-pad, I cannot comment to that.So how does it work on 220? Just fine. There was no smoke, sparks, and the building didn't go dark when I plugged it in. Now, I will take time to caution you about something. If you plug this into 220..Guess what, you get 220 out. So make sure the item you plug in is duel voltage. this may sound like common sense here, but after reading some reviews over on the page where I bought my plug adapter, it seems common sense may not apply. This is only a power strip, not a voltage converter.Bottom line...If you travel worldwide and need a power strip that can handle 110 or 220, then this is it!! get yourself some good plug adapters and your set.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Works worldwide 110 or 220", "unixReviewTime": 1330214400, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2012"}

Not as good as sound isolating buds of course, but it's a noticeable improvement. Ships with around 8 extra inserts of different sizes and types.Playback Quality: It's ok for an in-ear, cheap earphone. The bass is a bit punchy though which is nice. Voice quality is good even if music playback is somewhat lacking. Music quality seems a bit better after using it for a week (burn in). Note that JLab's has some special burn-in instructions on their website.Android Compatibility: This is the reason I bought this headset. The button on the microphone housing will pause audio playback on my Nexus S 4g. Works for both the default music app and my podcast app \"BeyondPod\".Other notes: Cable is fairly long (4'3\" or so). Treble boosting equalizer settings make the audio output more to my tastes. Also, see the bulky nub right near the headphone jack in the pictures? I was worried I wouldn't be able to plug it into my smartphone since I have a case on it which recesses the headphone port. Luckily there's enough clearance on the plug for me to get it in.Microphone Quality: Jostling the dongle while talking to people (say if you're running or repositioning it) only produces a mild disturbance. Transmit volume seems a bit on the low side so you might have to speak up a bit. Haven't had a chance to test in windy conditions.Update:I recommend looping this earbud around your ear. It helps reduce noise caused by the cable rubbing against your shirt,it makes the earbud less likely to be pulled out of your ear, and it moves the microphone dongle up to shirt-collar level which gives better audio quality.I wish they would have included a volume control on the dongle. The audio playback and call volume on my phones are a little mismatched so it would help if I could adjust it without having to fish around in my pocket for the volume buttons on the phone.The manual does not offer a complete list of controls, so I thought I'd compile my own here:During Podcast Playback (BeyondPod Podcast Manager):One Press - Pause and resumePress and Hold - Skip 30s forward in current songTwo Fast Press - Manual says is should skip to next track, however sometimes this works for me and sometimes it doesn't.Three Fast Press - Manual says is should skip to previous track, however sometimes this works for me and sometimes it doesn't.During Playback from Android Music App:One Press - Pause and resumePress and Hold - Next song in party shuffle playlist (works inconsistently)Two Fast Press - Skips to next track (works most of the time)Three Presses - Seems to just be considered as two fast presses and a single press.

The Winegard tech support was excellent in helping me and describing the ins and outs of antennas and DTV signals. Put it in my attic using the Winegard mounting bracket (well worth the $17, heavy duty). Now this antenna is 11' long, so I assembled it in the attic between the upright supports (angled towards the antenna farm). Then turned it on edge and slipped it through the upright support 2 x 4's to center it on one 2x4 before turning it back to level. The upright support 2x4 in the middle of the antenna was where I put the support bracket. Then ran a 50' cable to the TV, rescanned for channels and got 37 crystal clear DTV channels at 99-100% signal strength!!! And because the antenna is not amplified, I do not need to adjust the gain. Many channels are in 1080 and as clear as a blueray movie. Very good construction and made in the US. Note: my roof has shingles and decreases signal by 50%, so original 37 decibel signal becomes 18.5 decibels; 50' of cable cuts out 25% of signal so signal is down to ~14 decibels at the TV. You need 6 decibels for a perfect picture. Welcome to free DTV and lots of great non-violent programing that you do not get on cable! The DTV signal is sensitive to things in the line of sight including trees, roofs (shingles, barrel tiles are worse), than an analogue signal, so take that into account when picking out your antenna. tvfool.com has a lot of very useful information, you can input your address and find which antennas are close to you and what is their direction and signal strength.

Also, the MkII version promises better, fuller bass transmission, which was also a reason for me to buy them. Fact is that the MkIs do sound a bit thin with my Microsoft Zune player (yes, there were actually real people who bought the Zune instead of the iPod ...) - which is not the earbud's fault, not at all. So, I expected a boost in bass, more oomph, less tin-can, and just a better sound overall. Well, yeah, kind of the MkIIs do that. But the difference is not that pronounced as I had expected. Let's face it, the Zune just sucks in the sound department, and no headset/earbuds in the world can change that.Next, I mated the earbuds to my very old Sandisk MP3-player from 2008 (four years - what a difference ...), and was equally disappointed. Thin, shrieky and only after heavy manipulation of the onboard equalizer, I was able to generate a tolerable sound.Then, I tried the MkIIs on my trusted old Sony MP3-Walkman (2010 vintage) - WOW!Like standing right in front of the band! Clear, powerful, transparent sound with full basses and overall a very distinctive progress over the MkI model.That was exactly what I had in mind when I bought the MkIIs.My little field-study showed, at least in my opinion, that you need a high-quality player to really take advantage of these earbuds.

The first thing i did was download the drivers from the Alfa website. This was quite a pain because the FTP servers were offline so i couldn't even download the drivers. After waiting 30 minutes it was back online and i sat threw a 20 minute download because their servers were lagging. The installation was good, it also installs a utility which may be useful if you would like to check signal strength, link quality and throughput.At first i was amazed to see every signal i was able to get before, now has a signal of either 4 or 5 bars. It was basically a green light show. The signal i was connecting to had a RSSI of about -50 to -60, which was a vast improvement over the -80 to -90 i was getting before. Something felt a bit off though... i was unable to connect to the wifi network even though i was \"magically\" getting a signal twice as good. After running the utility i noticed the signal was good, but the link quality was extremely low at about 20-30%. With some adjusting i was able to find a location that was giving me around 50-70% link quality and i was able to connect now. After a few days i experienced a link quality that was all over the place. One minute i would get good speeds, the next i would get not so good speeds. No matter what i did i just could not get a proper link quality.The adapter is very light but feels rather cheap, definitely treat it with care. I found the omni and panel antennas to perform about the same. Although with the panel if you take the time to pinpoint the direction, you can achieve a better connection. The antenna cup could be useful depending on your situation.After using the adapter for a few days i decided to just plug in my TL-WN722N and use it with the panel antenna that came with this package. Readings were around -80 to -86 RSSI but i was getting a much more stable connection. Downloads, browsing and gaming were all faster. This seems a bit odd because i was getting a better connection with 2 bars opposed to 4-5. After doing a bit more research on the problem some people report the 1000mw adapter might actually be too strong for certain connections and causes interference. Personally i feel like the readings this adapter claims to receive might be inflated in some way. Whatever the case, i get better performance using an adapter half the price of this Alfa unit. At least the panel came in handy, but i would have rather just bought the panel and saved $35. I am not saying this adapter is bad, many people make reviews about how amazing it is.

The bass that was once strong got loose and the high or treble was cracking, I was getting ear fatigue.  I wanted to try anther brand like Grado, which I consider 12 years ago, but after reading all the reviews here on amazon took a leap of fate and just got it.  I couldn't be happier, it is exactly like my Senn 570 but better.  I took my old ipod into a Magnolia HiFi and tested theGrado Prestige Series SR325isandSennheiser HD 598.  The Grado easy has extreme high and treble or what some people might call bright, Sennheiser is has a tad more bass and over warmth feeling in the bass.  I do like techno, classic, some rock, basically everything, so i need a balanced headphone.  Grado would kill my ear in techno if I listen too long, Senn didn't have the detail I heard in the Grado 325.  Well I do believe, but 100% correct since I don't have a 325 or 598 to test right now, but I believe this headphone is between the 2.  Almost as bright detail as Grado and a tighter bass of the Senn, perfect.  I haven't even burn in the cone, and it sound good the first time I put it on.  I think the Senn 590 took awhile too and like 6 years ago it was at it peak.Sound quality:I prefer open-air headphones like in Senn, Grado and Akg.  I dislike the close sound of the power bass of Bose, Sony, beat by Dr. dre. While the sound is good it feels like I am in a cave.  I might considerBowers & Wilkins P5which is another bass emphasis headphone if I had a work headphone and needs privacy.The AKG high and mid excel for techno music like Armin Van Buuren, the bass is tight but not overwhelming (nor does it crack like the old 570), I can heard the vocal as the Senn 570.  The high ambient is sharp and clear.  For classic like Bob Acri- sleep away (free in window vista) the drum and bass, piano score are all excellent again. For example JaRule's let ride, the bass is tight, but isn't as powerful or warmth/full as one of those Beat by Dre, or Bower headphone.  But I don't listen to hip hop that much, just for reference.  Soft rock or vocal like Julee Cruise- Summer Night sounds great.  I be honest, why I don't give a 5 stars to this 702 is it sound very much like the Senn 570 back at peak period, except the 702 is a little clear and sharper toward Grado.  SO overall it is my favorite balance of high, mid and low that I was looking for long period of listening before ear fatigue creeps in.Build quality:it is almost exactly like my old 150 dollar hd570, the only noticeable exception is the headband is a tad tight.  Wished it was long or so.  The velvet foam cushion is like the 570, the detachable cord is the same concept.  Both are mostly plastic, bu the AKG band is a little different and also a tad heavier.  I give it a 4/5 stars too, because it is a tad tight and I notice it as wear it all the time.  Hopefully it loosen up over the years.  Cable is 2x as thick as the Senn.If somebody prefer the bright sound of grado, or the more bass of the senn, it is all good headphone.  I wish I had a bower for bass, senn as I am a fan of them, but if I had to pick one that I think sound the best overall to the music I like then it must be this 702.  for the record this headphone does not spasm-out on the bass like the senn 570 for enigma's Eppur Si Muove.

Go there and see what stations you can realistically receive with different antennas.I live in Salem, OR and the target trasmitter for me is in Portland - 48 miles away.TVfool predicts about 25 stations in the line-of-sight (LOS), with 8 strong enough for indoor antenna.First I bought in a local store one of those flat Ipad-like omniderectional amplified indoor antennas. It was able to pull in 4-5 major stations and then a few strongest analog independents, more or less consistent with TVfool report. The cutoff seemed to be about 50 dB of noise margin (NM) which left out 3 major networks with NM in 45-50 dB in VHF HI band and a whole lot of weaker independent stations. I just wanted those missing PBS, NBC and FOX channels, therefore I bought this antenna.Set it up on the outside wall with 30 ft of RG6 cable directly to TV. That gave me more than 15 channels (not counting all the decimal subchannels)and all the major HD ones come in clear and loud. The cutoff for the worst signal with this antenna appears to be about 25 dB NM - that's the lowest station on the TVfool list that I could identify. Very impressive - 25 dB improvement over amplified room antenna! And it beats the advertised distance of 40 miles handily.I managed not to break the transformer-balun thingy, but still bought on Ebay a good quality one (Channelmaster brand) as a spare. I am going to install it anyway - probably would make the signal even better.Overall very happy, despite one nut missing from the hardware pack.

I have a fancier universal remote, but I just don't like it and it drains batteries far too fast. I was excited about this remote and sat down to program it only to be disappointed. It worked out of the package with my cable box and the first Samsung code worked for my TV.Now the bad: there aren't ANY blu-ray codes for this remote. I tried every Sony DVD code and none of them worked with my Sony blu-ray player. I could not get the remote to work with my Panasonic soundbar either. There are four devices in my living room, and this remote does not work with two of them. I am very disappointed since I really liked the remote. My mom will hopefully get some use out of it in her bedroom for her TV and DVD player (though she still has to use the cheap Comcast remote for her DTA box).UPDATE: I finally got around to setting up the remote in my mom's room.  I was thoroughly shocked when I got the remote to work with the Comcrap DTA box.  I would bump this review up to 2 stars because it actually works with the DTA box, however, before I set up the cable box I discovered I could not change channels on the TV itself.  Whenever I pressed a button to change the channel, the remote would only attempt to use the not-yet-set-up cable device no matter how many times I pressed the TV device button.  Most of the time that's fine, but if you need to switch from channel 3 to 4 on your TV, you will need another remote or have to use the TV buttons.  Maybe I expect too much out of a remote, but I had a great one until Comcrap's mandatory DTA boxes came along and made it mostly useless.  Hopefully this remote will be of more use to my mom with her TV than it was for us in the living room, and at least for now she only needs one remote to watch cable TV (the Comcrap remote doesn't fully work with her older TV), and it seems to work with her DVD player.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Doesn't work with half my living room devices", "unixReviewTime": 1353974400, "reviewTime": "11 27, 2012"}

The product image shows a charger that has an AC plug, and it says the charging current is 2000mA max for AA, 1000mA max for AAA. The actual charger I got is a much smaller unit which accepts DC input from either an AC-to-5V adapter, or a 12V-to-5V car adapter.From the back of the charger unit, it says the charging current is just 450mA for 1-2 AA/AAA cells, 225mA for 3-4 cells. Obviously, this cannot be a '1-hour' charger. For example, to fully recharge a pair of 2900mAh AA cells it will take at least 7 hours (because 2900mAh/450mA = 6.4 hours). If you want to recharge 3-4 cells, then the charge time is doubled. So this is more like an 'overnight' charger rather than a 'rapid' charger.[Note: the actual charging current I measured is only around 330mA instead of 450mA as rated. That means the charge time is even longer]Speed issue aside, this little charger is actually quite smart. It can recharge each cell individually, which is much better than most cheap chargers that can only charge in pairs. The LCD panel has a blue LED backlight. It shows four battery status bars, each with three segments. During charging, all status bars cycle from low to high a few times, then they pause to display the relative fullness of each battery. Charging stops when all three segments are filled. If you accidentally put in an alkaline cell, the charger is smart enough to detect it and flashes the status bar to indicate an error.The AC adapter is rated for input=100-240V AC, output=5V 1A DC. But the actual current drawn by the charger is only 0.5A, which explains why it is so slow. The good news is that you can power this charge through any USB ports (5V 0.5A) from your computer or other USB adapter. Conversely, you can also use the included AC adapter and car adapter to recharge other USB-powered appliances - if you have the right cable.On the other hand, the four rechargeable batteries included in this package are very poor. They are rated for '2900mAh', but the actual average capacity is just 1940mAh (and this is measured after running SIX discharge/recharge cycles on myLa Crosse BC1000 charger/analyzer). They also appear to be suffering from higher internal resistance, which means they are unable to sustain high current under load.Bottom Line:If you are just looking for a small USB-powered charger and don't care about speed, then this Zeikos package is still worth considering. Otherwise, I recommend getting a package with better charger and batteries, such as theSony Cycle Energy BCG34HLD4KN Power Charger with 4 Pre-Charged 2000 mAh AA Batteries.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Charger is smart but very slow, batteries are junk", "unixReviewTime": 1333324800, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2012"}

{"reviewerID": "A24F83KRAZKWR5", "asin": "B002HGFKR8", "reviewerName": "Craig", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "For a couple of years now I've suffered with an 8GBSuper Talent PicoUSB drive that's had a knack of corrupting larger files that I've wanted to store on it. The main reasons I put up with it (often packing files in a rar archive with extra parity info or using par2 files to survive the corruption issues) were its sheer size (or lack thereof) and speed.However, the time finally came for me to consider replacing it as I've bumped into the 8GB limit when moving stuff around for work. I'd looked at various USB flash drives on Amazon, but was mostly unimpressed. The faster drives all tend to be large, and the small ones (I'm looking at you,SanDisk Cruzer Fit) all tend to be abominably slow (4MB/sec would take more than 2 *hours* to fill a 32GB drive). I was seriously considering just living with a full-size USB drive on my keychain. I knew I'd sorely miss the size of the Pico, but reliability and speed were my main concerns.I'm not sure how I found it while poking around Amazon, but I stumbled this little elago reader, and it seemed to be perfect for my needs. It's definitely got the form factor right (it's actually half the length of the Pico), and I figured with the right microSD card I'd get the speed and reliability I'd been looking for. At under 10 bucks, I figured it was low-risk and decided to give it a go.I managed to pick up aSanDisk Ultra 32 GBmicroSD card for a little under the \"normal\" price to go with the reader. Formatted as NTFS (to allow for storage of files > 2GB and to offer better multi-platform support than exFat), this combination of reader + card performs pretty well. Tested under 64-bit Linux, writes of large files tend to run at 15-16MB/sec, and reads at a slightly higher 19-20MB/sec or so, which is a slight improvement in performance over the Supertalent device I've been using until now. If I ever need to fill the drive from empty, it should take about 35 minutes (instead of the 2+ hours I'd get from many other small USB sticks).On top of that, I'm impressed that the device this small has a standard USB 'A' connector. The Pico's connector is non-standard; it's slightly too large for most USB ports, resulting in more force than is necessary to plug the drive into a PC, and it's possible to plug it in upside down, with the unfortunate side-effect of shorting out the USB's power and ground connections.The main thing I can think of that would improve this little reader would be a proper microSD latch (it's basically just a friction fit) to hold the card in place, with a better eject mechanism. The little yellow tab to eject the card seems like it's too easy to accidentally push either when inserting the reader into a PC or when it's in a pocket. Frankly, the best mechanism I can think of would have been something you shove a paperclip into; something like that would have been easily accessible without a special tool, but hard (if not impossible) to eject the SD card by accident.For now, I just pulled the yellow tab completely out of the reader (it came out fairly easily using just a fingernail to remove it, and seems to go back in fairly easily), and the SD card can still be pushed out with a simple tool (a pencil, paperclip, toothpick or even a small twig will do) which seems to be a decent improvement. If that proves insufficient, I'll just use a dab of epoxy to make the SD card a permanent fixture.I'm also not sure why this reader bothers with an LED. There's a blue LED hidden somewhere in the guts of the thing that isn't easily visible (it sort of shines through the hole for the lanyard) but it's on all the time, and doesn't indicate device activity in any way. I just don't see the point of that, to be honest.For under $10, this turns a microSD card of up to 32GB capacity into a wonderful little USB flash drive. It's a great idea; it gives a tiny form factor, and you can choose a reliable SD card instead of having to put up with some 3rd-rate flakey flash.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Brilliant idea, mostly well executed", "unixReviewTime": 1354579200, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2012"}

If you understand that the value of the warranty diminishes with your repair claims, then you're OK. The point of the ST warranty is to make sure your computer runs for the duration of the warranty period OR fix or replace it up to, or until, the face value of the warranty is met. Meaning: if you have warranted the computer for $1000, and it is repaired at a repair cost of $200, your remaining warranty is only good for $800 worth of additinoal repairs or refund during the warranty period. I understand this and think it is a fair policy which helps keep pricing affordable.My claims experience with SquareTrade is twofold. About a year into the warranty my touchscreen laptop had a screen problem. SquareTrade repaired it quickly. Unfortunately the screen still occassionally lost its touch ability, but this seemed more software based than hardware as a reboot would correct. All in all I was happy with the repair. The cost of the repair was valued at roughly $250, which seemed reasonable.About a year after that, in a rush, I unfortunately dropped the laptop and broke it severely. I felt terrible as this is my daughter's computer which she loves. Since we had Accidental Damage protection (thought we might need it for my daughter and not for me!) I frantically called SquareTrade. My call was taken care of quickly and professionally. I sent the laptop in and in 2 days was greeted with a warranty payment equal to the face amount minus the $250 previous repair charge. This allowed me to replace my daughter's computer quickly (and with less of a wallet impact) and not have an issue with her school work.Worked exactly as advertised by SquareTrade and I am very happy with their service.

I wanted to keep the factory radio because I was happy with the sound and use my iPhone for all my in car infotainment anyway.  I use the Pandora and SiriusXM Apps for music and the Adam Carolla and Stitcher Apps for my podcasts.  I use the free Waze App for navigation.  I also like the automatic volume adjustment with vehicle speed in the factory unit - a useful feature in a convertible!  Ford does not sell a dedicated iPhone cable that works through the factory head unit even though there is an Aux button on the radio.  This product got positive reviews and seemed to do everything I wanted so I decided to give it a try.The installation took one afternoon by myself.  I got the instructions on how to remove the radio from Crutchfield - they will give this to you for free if you purchase any car audio equipment from them or you can pay $10 for them without another purchase.  As recommended in another review, I used 2 splitters (1-male-into-2-female RCA connectors) so that I could use both the iPhone cable and the Aux headphone jack inputs.  I did not want to cut into my wiring harness for 12V power so I used a fuse tap (also pictured above) in an open fuse location for power.  This resulted in an \"always on\" power supply, even when the car is off (as opposed to the power just coming on with the car's ignition).  I was worried that this might put a constant power drain on the battery but it does not appear to do so as long as the switch is off and the iPhone is not connected.  I ran all wires in split corrugated tubing to protect them and went pretty zip-tie happy to make everything neat.  I would recommend removing the trim panel on which you are going to mount the switch and/or aux input jack and drilling the holes from behind.  My drill skipped a little bit on the hard plastic and made a few scratches.  The iPhone holder I used is a ProFit Bravo minigrip (model BR-200BG).  It is held on with a 3M adhesive pad that is not supposed to leave a mark when you remove it.  I think it looks nice and holds the phone securely.  It is also fully adjustable.I am very happy with the final result.  I have uploaded pictures of my install if you are interested.  It looks nice and the only exposed wire is the iPhone connector by necessity.  It charges the phone and all audio plays through this cable without the need for a second cable plugged into the headphone jack on the phone.  I did not have to adjust the output level on the box.  It is about as loud as the radio (but who really listens to the radio anyway, right? Isn't that why you are buying this thing in the first place?).  I'm not an audiophile but the sound is super clear without any static at all using either the iPhone cable or the Aux input.  I use a 3GS iPhone and it is fully compatible.  My wife has a 4S iPhone which I have not tried yet but certainly can if anyone is interested.Overall I am very happy with this purchase and the ease of installation.  It was hundreds of dollars cheaper than a new stereo and gives me exactly what I wanted - iPhone and Aux input capability.  Only time will tell how durable it is as some of the lower rated reviews report that their unit failed after 6-9 months.  I'll certainly addend this post if mine fails.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive and pretty easy way to add a line-in to any factory (or aftermarket) car stereo.

The box fits in the little pocket behind the wheel well, in front of the tail light.  So, I wanted a 10 that could fit the box but still produce some good lows!  I thought I was going to be disappointed since it was only 1 - 10\" sub now...totally not the case.  I couldn't be happier with this sub woofer!  The lows that this reproduces are amazing.  It rivals the lows of some 12's out there.  The SSI (Selectable Smart Impedance) was the gimmick that sold me on it, not that I needed it, but basically because of Infinity's creative development of this switch.  It allows expandability of your sub woofer (quantity of subs) without being stuck with an improper impedance sub based on your layout or future layout.  Plus, Infinity is made by Harmon, so I knew this was going to be a quality sub.  I am powering it with an Eclipse 1000XA Mono Amp (450W RMS, 1000W peak) so it matches this sub woofer well.  I also like the styling/aesthetics of the cone.  There's nothing negative that I can even think of at this point.  I've had friends in the past that have owned Infinity subs & were total fan boys.  I've owned Kenwood, Pioneer, Alpine, Polk, Eclipse & Kicker sub woofers & this one is the best (Single) 10\" sub I've heard from my past experiences.

Find the size of adapter you need, THEN snap it in.  The adapters are difficult to remove so make sure of the size before putting it in.  I did not have the correct one selected and had to use a steak knife (my favorite tool) to remove it.  This will work on all of Apple's 30 pin phones and iPods.  I have a gummy case on my iPod 4g touch, so I am using my iPod without an adapter.Setup is fast as all you must do is plug it in!There are 3 small buttons (volume up, volume down and power) on the top right side, which are sort of firm to press.This does not take battery power.I am going to try using the iPod in the unit as my alarm clock tomorrow and am not sure if that will work, and will update this review after trying that.I really like the unit and might wait until when it goes on sale again and buy another.Pros:Rich, full soundRemoteSmall foot printFast setupStylishBrand name companyCons:Does not use batteriesUpdate:I used the unit with my iPod as an alarm and it was very good.

All the wires are color-coded to the corresponding ports on the main hub/subwoofer.- Sound quality is just fine.- The system comes with plenty of wire for a small living-room.- The controls are simple and intuitive.- You can adjust the subwoofer level, the center speaker volume, the front L/R speaker volumes, and the back L/R spear volumes.- The small, inconspicuous speakers are easy to hide amongst the decor of your room.- You really can't crank it up enough to disturb the neighbors. I think this counts as a blessing in disguise.Cons:- It has plenty of volume for attentively watching a movie, but if you're trying to listen to music while doing any noisy chores or if you're trying to fill the house with music, you'll wish you had more volume.- The back speakers are much quieter than the front speakers when playing music. I was hoping to fill my whole living room with surrounding music but instead the volume is heavily weighted to the front speakers. For surround-sound movies they seem to be at the right levels.- The subwoofer is ok, but you can't get great bass out of it. Don't even think about throwing a dance party.- The remote only works if you have an unobstructed beeline from the front of the remote to the front of the hub.- You're likely to put the subwoofer in a shadowy place (under your tv table or behind the tv), meaning that the black, non-backlit controls will be impossible for you to read when you try to adjust anything.

So WATCH what you read!  The review may NOT be for the UPS unit you actually want to buy!  The only way to know for certain is if the reviewer NAMES WHICH CyberPower UPS unit they are reviewing!I ordered the CP350SLG because it was only 10 bucks after an Amazon credit.  FIRST, I DID INDEED check on replacement battery costs!  But after getting this POS, even though it states on the battery \"CPS3.6-12\", it's not!  Crosses to that # (such as BP3.6-12) are much too large and do not fit!  This *particular* CPS3.6-12 is TINY: only about 4\" long (101mm) x 2.5\" H (64mm) x 1.85\" W (47mm).  It is possible (as another 1-star reviewer said), to Dremel out some of the enclosure but you can only use a SLIGHTLY LONGER battery, maybe 115mm long, you CANNOT use a battery that is wider or thicker because there's not enough room!  (Also note you need a special tool to remove the battery compartment screw!  It looks like a \"Torx\" bit, but a tiny screwdriver worked for me).Be aware that when you search to try and find a \"CPS3.6-12\" replacement battery, DO NOT get it UNLESS they give the dimensions and they match!  So far I have YET to find a replacement battery that FITS, sites that give the dimensions are all way too long at about 5.24\" long.  (That's about 1.5\" too long!)The jerks at CyberPower FAIL TO DISCLOSE THIS replacement battery info at their webpage for this unit!  If I would have KNOWN this I would have ordered a different unit!So IF I end up keeping this, I'm just going to use any 12v ~3.6Ah battery (the cheapest you can find) and leave it outside the enclosure!  Not pretty, but it will work.  (BTW, ReplaceUPSbattery.com seems to have the best prices and with a 2yr warranty).1-star, due to the fact you can't find a replacement battery!UPDATE: Here's a direct quote from CyberPower in their reply to an email I sent asking about a replacement battery:\"The information is on our website, I can't speak to the websites selling them though. These small UPS units (350, 425, 500, 550) are inexpensive to the point where buying a new battery is going to cost almost as much as replacing the whole unit. For what it's worth we do recommend these be recycled, not just tossed.\"My reply to that:\"......Being a \"disposable\" unit is not at your website!  You must be looking at a different website.  In fact, it even says \"REPLACEMENT\" battery:\"Replacement Battery | BB Battery - CPS3.6-12\"At: [why do these jerks remove all URL's??

(included)\".Replacement batteries are usually about $18-$24 delivered, with the most common types being about $20 (UB1280 & crosses).

Some people complain about sweaty ears, but I honestly can't say I haven't had a case where wearing any set of headphones doesn't give me sweaty ears.  I just grab a cotton swab when my ears get to sweaty, so I don't really go for the whole \"they make your ears sweat\" thing because of course they do.

Lack", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "This is the first time I've ever bought a sound card and I figured why not have one of the best ones on the market. I've always been against sound cards because I felt they were a waste of money and the the improvement to sound wasn't worth the money.Well after using the card for a few months I can say I was completely wrong with being against sound cards, at least this one. It eliminated some fuzziness I'd hear when I turned the volume higher, drastically changed the clarity of everything and separated different sounds brilliantly.If you've never owned a sound card you should definitely get this one. You don't realize how terrible the sound you have now is till you get one. Everything sounded so muddy and rough before and now it's literally like I'm standing right next to the person talking or the artist singing. Plugging in my Sennheiser HD 598's into the sound card and listening to vocal tracks in FLAC is nothing short of amazing! You really do feel as though you were at the recording studio listening to them sing or in the front row of a concert. You hear every breath, every string strummed, imperfections of somebody missing a note or voice slightly cracking, every breath the artist takes. You literally hear everything that was recorded whether you want to or not!My advice to you if you're going to buy a sound card of this caliber is to make sure you have fairly expensive headphones and speakers. You'd really be doing yourself a major disservice buying a $200 sound card and using some cheap $40 speakers and a pair of $60 headphones. If you don't want to spend the money on expensive headphones and speakers then please don't buy this sound card because it won't be worth it for you. You'd hear the same sound quality on a $20 sound card so there's no reason to pay that much money for something that won't sound any different.My only issue with the Xonar Essence ST so far is sometimes it won't work when I turn my computer on. When I bought the card a few months ago I was running Windows 7 64-Bit and it was a nightmare getting the card to work. I'd turn on my computer, I'd hear the card turn on, then I'd try to play something and there would be no sound. I'd check the input to make sure everything was right, I'd check the audio mixer in Windows 7 to make sure there's sound (Which there was) and there was no way to get it to work. I'd have to restart my PC and it sometimes would work again and other times it would require another restart to get it to work again.When I upgraded to Windows 8 Pro 64-Bit the new drivers completely solved the issue of the card not working. That solved the problem for about 2 months and then I did a update to Windows 8 and now the problem has returned. Granted, it happens way less now then it did before but it's still very annoying to have to restart your PC once you figure out you don't have sound.Overall this is an amazing card that should be added to everyone's computer that loves music, It's a lot of money to spend on just a sound card but I think you're ears are worth it. Your ears listen to a lot of garbage throughout the day, they deserve to be spoiled every once in awhile!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fantastic but the drivers need work.", "unixReviewTime": 1356307200, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2012"}

The shoulder strap could be a little more comfortable, but I replaced mine with another strap from a Tamarac bag.

I use them as my main DJing headphones, and beingSennheiser HD25-1 II Closed-Back Headphones's at heart, this is the classic pair of headphones many DJ's have come to love, now with a little bit of flair.Sound quality: Really good quality.  The sound is crisp, the lows reach deep and the highs have great clarity. The sound feels very closed in though, being tightly closed headphones, so I definitely prefer my open-backedBeyerdynamic DT 990 PRO Open Studio Headphones 250 Ohmsfor leisurely listening.  In the DJ booth, though, these sound great.Isolation: These headphones keep out sound pretty well.  As you'd expect it cannot match the isolation you'd get from most in-ear earbuds, but as far as conventional headphones go these do a great job. You'd think that over the ear headphones would do a better job than on-ear ones, but this beats out my old headphones, Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones (excellent headphones by the way), as far as isolation goes. As for leaking sound out, I don't really care about it so I don't know (I use different earbuds when I'm on the go) but they're decent at that, too.Comfort: They are more or less comfortable, although over time they start to get a little painful since, in the name of isolation, they clamp down on your head fairly hard.  I can't use these for easy listening usually just because my head starts to hurt over time, as these press my ears against my head hard.Style: This one is really up to you.  I think they look pretty cool (the all black original version of these headphones are pretty bland if you ask me) though they can rub people in two ways: a) some people presume they are cheap and plasticky (which perhaps is a plus against thieves!); b) they look a little immature/tacky.

Too much oxygen also probably destroys the Higgs bosons in the cheap HDMI cable, which is probably why I cannot view my Blu-rays in the 2160P that my videophile friend's expensive HDMI cable allows.

When I first cut the device on, my PC (Windows 8 Release Preview) recognized the drives instantly, via USB 3. When I started copying my music to my 1.5TB drive plugged into the device, the connection was lost after about 45 seconds. I couldn't see any of the drives. I went straight to my control panel/System/Device Manager. There I noticed an exclamation mark under Universal Serial Bus controllers. I deleted this item, restarted my PC and the unit was back. Before continuing I unplugged/re-plugged the device several times, and it was recognized when plugged in each time.NOTE:There IS NOT a USB transfer problem in Windows 7 nor Windows 8 Release Preview during large transfers. This IS an issue with early versions of the USB 3.0 drivers. I had a problem during large transfers of the drive's in the docking bay disconnecting randomly, until I updated my USB 3.0 drivers. Go to your control panel, System and Security, System, Device Manager. Scroll down to your Universal Serial Bus controllers and look for your 3.0 Host Controller or 3.0 Root Hub. Here you will see the mfg. and know where to go to get updated drives for your system. Mine was Renesas, so I went there, found the latest versions of the firmware and drivers for my USB 3.0 and have had no problem transferring files since I updated my drivers. You may need to update the firmware on your StarTech docking bay, there are instructions on there site for this. Hope this helps anyone with problems using this docking bay.I've copied 2.5TB of movies to one of my WD drives, 1 TB of music and about another TB of pictures to my other WD drive and a backup to the Seagate. After I finished copying the movies, (my movie drive is shared via my network to my TV via my WD HD TV box) my daughter watched movies most of the night with one of her friends.

I've used it for 9 months and have never had to change the batteries. I do use 2 batteries with it instead of one though. So that I'm sure helps the battery life.This mouse is smooth and quite good.

The V-Moda \"Octave\" Hi-Def earbuds sound pretty fantastic with a balance between clear, higher ranges (treble) and thumping lower ranges (bass). The rubber earbud protectors are comfortable (I prefer earbuds so if you have trouble with this headphone style you should continue to stay away) even after hours of use. They feel and look pretty durable, even when compared to the Bass Freqs so I thought I'd picked a complete winner. Unfortunately, I kept getting a nagging feeling that I was missing something. For my test music, I played a hip-hop song I knew to be full of bass and listened to it with both the Bass Freqs and the Octaves. The 'thumping' base I thought was quite acceptable on the Octaves turned out to be no so much when compared to the Bass Freqs. I don't listen to a lot of hip-hop/rap, but I do love to hear bass in whatever I'm playing and so I am a little disappointed that the Octaves aren't quite as powerful as the Bass Freqs.On the other hand, for about $30 you do get a very good-sounding pair of earbuds with their own carrying bag, a set of earhooks to attach to the earbuds, a splitter so another listener can enjoy the beats with you (assuming you want to sit that close;) and extra silicone fitters for the buds (which, by the way, appear sturdier than the Bass Freqs, which seem to go a little soft after a couple months of use so the noise-canceling seal isn't as great). I've decided to stick with the Bass Freqs for iPod listening, and I've been using these Octaves for my part-time transcription job; they cancel noise better than any other headset I've tried and because the higher tones come through darn-near crystal clear, recorded speech is amazingly easy to pick up.Verdict: I love the headset, just not for what I originally purchased them for. If the bass was as rich and deep as the Bass Freqs while still maintaining clear higher tones, the Octaves would be 5-star for sure.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Can't Replace the Bass Freqs", "unixReviewTime": 1332460800, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2012"}

While not failure proof, this drive is the most reliable from the most common 2TB high performance drives. An article by Marc Prieur, published on BeHardware web site, lists hardware return rates during warranty period for return of products sold between April  2011 and October 2011 and returned by April 2012. His breakdown for the return rate of most common 2TB drives is as follows:- 7.53% Seagate Barracuda XT 2 TB SATA 6Gb/s- 5.78% Western Digital RE4-GP 2 TB- 4.53% Hitachi Deskstar 7K3000 2 TB- 3.18% Western Digital Caviar Black 2 TB- 3.07% Western Digital AV-GP 2 TB- 2.55% Seagate Barracuda LP 2 TB- 2.31% Western Digital Caviar Green 2 TB WD20EARX- 2.15% Western Digital Caviar Green 2 TB WD20EARS- 1.80% Samsung SpinPoint F4 EcoGreen 2 TBWhile WD Caviar Black (in the middle of this list) is not a 2TB reliability winner, it is the most reliable high performance 2 TB drive on Marc Prieur's list. All drives with lower return rates (bottom half of the list) are slower energy efficient \"green\" drives: the next line down, Seagate Barracuda LP, is a 5900 rpm drive, and all further lines down are notebook-speed 5400 rpm drives.PERFORMANCE. This drive replaced my OEM drive Hitachi HDT721010SLA, which is also a 7200 rpm drive. The average read speed has increased from 90.2 MB/s to 117.7 MB/s, and access time has dropped from 18.7 ms to 11.7 ms. Burst rate, as measured with HD Tune Pro, has increased from 179.5 MB/s to 195.1 MB/s. Quick access time is likely the reason why WD recommends this drive for photo/video editing.LOUDNESS. Indeed, as many people pointed out, this drive creates quite audible clicking sounds, much louder than the Hitachi drive which it replaced. It is not loud at the level of being annoying, but loud enough to notice the difference, and louder than any other hard disk that I work with at home or at work. In fact, it reminded me of clicking from floppy drives from the old times. The sound is the only reason why I did not rate it 5 stars.INSTALLATION. It is a plug-and-play disk with very simple installation process. There are either no instructions included with the disk or they are minimal, but it is very easy to find on the internet how to partition and format a new disk under your operating system (the disk comes not formatted and not partitioned, so one has to go through several steps before it is recognized by the system and one can write on it).

The highs are crisp without an annoying emphasis on sibilance and the bass is deep and balanced but not overwhelming. It is easy to understand softly spoken dialogue (even on a noisy airplane).

There are inexpensive adapters for using lots of SLR lens types, and some old rangefinder lens types, with Micro Four Thirds cameras such as this one. With your old lens mounted, just set the camera mode to A for aperture priority, set the aperture on the lens to your desired f-stop, and the camera will automatically adjust the shutter and ISO for a good exposure. Manually focusing your lens is made easier because the viewfinder can magnify the subject you're focusing on.Moreover, the camera has in-body image stabilization, so the sensor compensates for camera shake. You just choose your lens's focal length from a menu, and the camera will permit slower shutter speeds without blur. Other camera lines put their image stabilization in their lenses, but the Olympus PENs have it in the body, so it can be used with any lens you mount on the camera.The camera has a full range of other digital features, and it produces images of excellent quality.Note that the Micro Four Thirds sensor, while several times the size of the sensor found in point-and-shoot digital cameras, is half the size of a frame of 35mm film. Consequently, any lens on an MFT camera will have the same angle of view as a lens with twice the focal length on a 35mm film camera. For example, a 50mm lens on an MFT camera will give the angle of view that a 100mm lens would give on a 35mm film camera.I should add that the lenses Olympus makes for its PEN cameras are excellent. The combination of the 14-42mm and 40-150mm zooms would cover a range equal to 28-300mm on a 35mm film camera, and with crisp autofocus and full autoexposure.

They are as follows:*  No Amazon Prime Compatibility (this is pretty big)*  It takes a long time to scan and ID my media library*  It did not recognize a lot of TV shows that I arranged by folder/season/episode and named 1, 2, 3, etc.In all fairness, I can still go to files and browse them manually, but it doesnt have the cover art/information as when it is identified. That makes it harder for my technologically challenged better half to use.I have started to manually identify files, but that is more difficult as it does not show the folder path so I have to play an episode, figure out what it is, and have it try to ID the rest of the folder. It would be so much easier to be able to see the file path and ID it as such.These complaints are fairly minor and there are workable alternatives. I must admit, the boxee box is the best thing short of a HTPC. The cost and ease of setup/use make it a much more viable option for me. As of right now, it is the sole thing that is streaming my media and I am pretty happy to have it. I would recommend it for those who are looking for a similar set of requirements.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works for local media and some internet apps (No Amazon Prime)", "unixReviewTime": 1344124800, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2012"}

I have a number of Win7 PCs in all flavors and have a WHS 2011 with 5TB of space set up.  I wanted to serve my media seamlessly to my TV.  I bought a Mac (Mac Mini) for the first time and the kids are happy with it - did this hoping it would see WHS media easily.  I also bought an AppleTV hoping it would be good for my purposes and work in a MAc ecosystem.  I also wanted to be able to update my media on the WHS media server and have a streaming device detect updates and changes automatically.  AppleTV was *not* the solution to this problem.  Getting iTunes to run on WHS 2011 was tough, but doable (separate user ID that doesn't log out and has iTunes running Home Sharing).  Updating the media in the iTunes library and having it recognized by the streaming device - now THAT was a pain.  I also wanted to keep the media in the WHS media folders (Music, Pictures, Video) without it being moved to another location, so \"Automatically Add to iTunes\" folder wasn't a solution.  I ditched the AppleTV and went for the Boxee.  It was recommended by friends and got some great reviews, so I thought I would try it.  It is AWESOME.  Great interface, automatically scans your home server, or whatever file share you set up, works with AirPlay and other sharing protocols  (had to set my WHS 2011 up by IP address as using the server name didn't yield any found media folders - weird).  I set up a specific user ID for the Boxee on the WHS to see the media in Read Only mode.  I LOVE the Video interface as it goes out and finds cover art for your MP4s and M4vs - some were unrecognized, so I have to figure that one out (maybe it's naming).  I have 18,000 songs, so as of this morning (12 hours of scanning so far) it's through about half of the songs.  I love the Boxee apps, but the one big one missing is Amazon Video (no, I don't work for Amazon and this is not a plug).  I subscribe to Prime and have the video app on my Panasonic Bluray player.  It would be a great addition to the Boxee as it competes directly with Vudu and is priced better for rentals - I'd also get more movies with Prime.  I like Amazon better because of its interface, too.  The Slingplayer built into the Boxee was also great.  It looks exactly like the interface on the iPhone - and you don't have to dish out another $29.99 for it like with all the other Slingplayer clients.The Boxee remote is great and reminds me of the Lenovo wireless handheld keyboard, minus the Lenovo trackball.The Boxee refurb worked like a charm out of the box.  The bottom of the Boxee was definitely dirty - but, it's the bottom.  As long as I don't lick it or keep the Boxee upside down, I'm fine.  I did get the Squaretrade warranty as the refurb clearly states \"Warranty for 30 days only\" right on the serial number sticker as another reviewer noted, so I had the heads-up.I have the Boxee hooked up via wired gigabit (not that it needs that kind of bandwidth, but it can't hurt).  I run 9k Jumbo frames from my home server, no hiccups so far.  Getting the battery for the remote inserted properly is the most important part when you set up.  I don't read instructions normally and couldn't figure out why the remote wasn't working and the box wasn't turning on.  First, I found the power button on the box in a place I didn't expect (kind of hidden on the top, back).  Next, duh, the battery was inserted upside down. (I figured this all out, still without reading the instructions).  I downloaded the Boxee app for iPhone but it seems to be very barebones and I haven't tried it yet.  Hopefully, some development will be done on it to make it a more interesting and functional interface - something to mirror the Boxee's excellent interface.The Mac sits in the house and keeps the kids entertained, but doesn't play nice with WHS 2011.  Time Capsule does not work, even with the 2011 connector installed and a read-write folder mapped to a drive.  All streamed media is playing through the Boxee.I still have iTunes running on the WHS with Home Sharing for the other iTunes clients in the house, but updating media is a pain.Overall, I'm VERY happy so far with the Boxee and the refurb was worth the 28% savings (50/180).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Boxee, WHS and AppleTV", "unixReviewTime": 1332374400, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2012"}

This is the AV model versus the standard switch of the same model number offered from Netgear. The difference is primarily the auto-QoS (Quality of Service) configuration that is built into the AV model.100-mbit switches are cheap and handle device and Internet connectivity without problem. If what you are doing is browsing the Internet and copying some DOC or MP3 files from laptop to desktop then any type of cheap switch should do the job for you. You're probably looking at a gigabit switch for a reason though. You want gigabit speeds because you have large media files that you store on a network attached storage (NAS) server with multiple devices accessing the content. If that's the case then this might be the switch for you. This switch will operate at close to gigabit speeds. I have seen over 700mbps transfer rates through this switch by copying large movies between systems. Take into consideration that when we start to achieve these speeds we must consider every component of the transfer to determine the maximum throughput. At gigabit speeds, a mechanical hard drive could become a bottleneck.The switch is plug and play. Connect the network cables, plug in the power, press the power toggle button and it's running. The connectivity lights on the front show the status. One nice feature is the lights on the front are dimmed relative to other switches. They won't light up an entire dark media room or draw attention. It uses some type of smoked plastic with lower power LEDs.The back of the switch has colored ports to indicate priority of the attached device. The switch will allow traffic from that port, based on the type of traffic it is, to trump trump traffic from lower priority ports. Therefore, I might allow my media server a higher priority than an XBox. This means if they were both reaching high throughput and the switch had to start making decisions on what to do with traffic it would allow the media server to achieve its objective. The switch also has settings to allow sensitive streams like streaming media to be prioritized over block level transfers. This is nice when someone is watching a move on a media center and someone else starts to copy a large file to/from one of the systems involved in theater experience. The switch will attempt to ensure that the movie is not interrupted by the file transfer.For QoS to work effectively, you need it to be configured at both ends of the network. This means if you have a living room media center and a NAS serving media in another room; you might want this switch to be deployed in both locations. You definitely want a gigabit switch in both locations but I'd recommend a QoS switch in both as well.Keep in mind, all of your network switches should be of the same speed throughout your network unless you know what you're doing. If you connect a fast ethernet switch to your NAS server and a gigabit switch to your media center PC then you're not going to get gigabit speeds between the two.This is an excellent price for this product and I would purchase it again.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent choice for media center", "unixReviewTime": 1356912000, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2012"}

And you DO need that cable. A regular DVI cable will not display.b) Make sure it is the LATEST revision number. Older revs. were faulty and will have alot of the problems other people mention. I believe mine was ver. 08. Build Aug 2011.Before I write anymore, I also want to say that I am an AVID gamer. I play 1st person shooters as well as RPGs and strategy games so an excellent monitor is a must for me.Now, I had a GREAT monitor before this, but I wanted something bigger and better and believed that I could find it. I bought several monitors and TVs and had to return them because they wouldnt do.The thing to remember is that you are not getting better than a good 24\" monitor that can run a 1900x1200 resolution or better. Forget it.Obviously, the bigger the monitor, the higher the resolution needs to be. So if you have a 27\" monitor sure you can run \"HD\", but so can any monitor nowadays. If you try and play high detail games on that monitor, you will be losing out BIG TIME.And that is what this monitor does well. It is a 27\" monitor with a high enough resolution for its size that you will get all the value of those intense graphics. Any 27\" monitor that has a resolution less that this one is only good for surfing the internet, using office, and watching movies.If that is all you will be doing, save ALOT of money and buy a monitor nhalf the price of this one.For me, this is not my dream monitor. I still want MORE vibrant and MORE \"WOW\", but like I said, I am an avid gamer and I LOVE graphics. I just dont think the next level of technology has gotten there yet.I think if Dell creates an LED monitor with this monitors resolution, it will be damn close, but that's not the case yet.Anti-glare: I have a window at my back so I am grateful for it. NO refelction AT ALL!problem 1) HARD TO CLEAN! You will have a heck of a time cleaning smudges. I dont notice the smudges when playing, but it annoys me when I see them.problem 2)you WILL see a LITTLE bit of greyness (what LOOKS like pixelation) on whites, but it's really forgettable. This is because the antiglare screen is like a hard piece of plastic with a very fine rough finish.Games: Works perfectly. I was a bit nervous going from a 5ms to a 6ms, but I tested a 2ms monitor and NO DIFFERENCE that I could see. High graphic 1st person shooters played smooth and just as well as my old turn based games.I would not worry about the ms rate, but REMEMBER to buy the latest revision monitor. Dont get fooled by some of these companies that are still trying to get rid of \"brand new\" monitors but OLD revisions with problems.Price: Well, I just had to suck it up. I wanted a great 27\" and I had to pay for it. I sold my other monitor for 250.00 and bought this one on Black Friday for 750.00. No tax and including shipping.Power hungry? Yes. Compared to an LED or smaller monitor, it does eat electricity.Monitor features are excellent, height and swivel adjustment: check. HDMI able? yes (though the DVI is better for computer graphics)So bottom line is that YES, this is the BEST 27\" monitor you will be able to get until Dell releases an LED monitor or another version of THIS monitor that increases resolution or colors, etc.I wanted to wait for something like that, but made a decision on Black Friday to go ahead and buy this one.When something better comes out, I'll sell this one and get it. ;)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great monitor", "unixReviewTime": 1328140800, "reviewTime": "02 2, 2012"}

I narrowed it down to 2 choices in my price range: this Sony and a Panasonic SC-HTB10. I chose the Sony because of the subwoofer. I am not disappointed with the bass, nor the treble -- it performs well at those ends of the audio spectrum. What is missing for me, though, is midrange.The audio sounds \"hollow,\" and I miss some dialogue in movies or speech in variety/comedy shows. (Full disclosure: I have a mild hearing loss, corrected by aids, so this may be my peculiar sensitivity.) I've experienced a similar sensation with my car stereo, but that has a midrange adjustment, so I can boost the midrange and it corrects the issue. Not so with the Sony soundbar. I have compensated a little bit by de-emphasizing the bass and treble response to hopefully emphasize the midrange, and emphasizing subwoofer to provide ambient bass -- it helps, but not the best.I read a consumer review online by someone who stated they had done a direct comparison between the Sony and Panasonic, and that person also claimed the Sony sounded hollow. If I were going to do it over, I'd try the Panasonic. I'll keep the Sony, though, because it works well enough and I don't watch a lot of TV.Regarding setup, I've noticed many purchasers stating dissatisfaction with how to hook soundbars up, especially not being able to integrate the soundbar with their TVs (i.e., not being able to have the TV HDMI control the soundbar volume and on/off). I was able to integrate the Sony soundbar with my Panasonic TV just fine, but the setup was not at all clear. I have an electronics background, so I may be more flexible and patient, but I can see how the average consumer could become confused and frustrated trying to follow the product instructions, especially if the TV and soundbar are from different manufacturers using different terminology.UPDATE Jan 2013: After trying various settings for over a year, I finally gave up on this soundbar because the lack of midrange just didn't allow me to hear everything. After further research I bought a Yamaha YAS-101 because some users stated they had hearing loss and found it worked well. That's been my experience too. The Yamaha has excellent frequency across the audio spectrum, and although it doesn't have thunderous bass, the bass is solid and appropriate.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Solid bass, crisp treble -- but where's the midrange?", "unixReviewTime": 1327795200, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2012"}

The day after I wrote this review, I started getting a crackling noise in the left earphone. Probably because I had my volume up too high and it got blown out.Original review:Picked this up at Walmart last year after blowing out my old Trittons because I could not wait for a new headset to be shipped to me. It was supposed to be a stand-in headset, until I could get a new one. Ten months later, I haven't ordered a new one because this one is still going strong.Let me start by saying that I am a constant user of Skype. I take conference calls for work, I talk to my family, I talk to my friends, and I talk to the people that I'm gaming with. The only time I'm NOT talking to people on Skype is when I'm working on a project or sleeping. I think it is safe to say that I have gotten a lot of use out of this headset.I can hear people just fine. I haven't had any crackling sounds like the two previous reviewers, and after 10+ months of use, it's still going strong. Nobody has ever complained about the microphone quality. When I hear a recording of myself, it sounds perfectly fine. The microphone is pretty sensitive, because I can hear myself click and type. A lot more clear than a regular telephone, but then most microphones are. It's not super crisp, but it's more crisp than most of the people I speak to. Are these as good as Trittons? Hell no. Sound-wise, Trittons would blow these out of the water. However, that isn't to say that these aren't decent. Unless you are doing hardcore gaming, I think these are more than agreeable. As for the microphone-- it isn't as good as the one on the my old Tritton headset, but it comes pretty darn close. For sixteen bucks (compared to 100 something for Trittons), that's impressive!I unplug this headset frequently because I switch between my laptop and desktop. Usually wires start shorting out after 2-5 months of this, but these ones have not yet! I've also rolled over the cord of this (probably 10 times or more) with my computer chair. Whatever casing they used for the wiring on this is great.If you wear glasses, you should consider a different headset.

Darien Freeheart", "helpful": [9, 11], "reviewText": "I ordered this to convert my spare bedroom into a \"photo studio\" - not a place for professional shooting but as a way to push a photography hobby to the next level. I'm what the camera circles call a \"prosumer\". Please remember that my assessment of \"cheap\" isn't compared to great studios I've shot in.First, the backdrop support system. It doesn't really support itself. The telescoping bar bends and flexes under it's own weight, with no backdrop or clips on it. This wasn't even my first sign of low-quality though, since the process of putting up the bar was difficult. The stands on each pole are wobbly. The legs aren't wide enough to properly support this while holding just the bar and the legs move laterally, decreasing stability even more. I can LITERALLY tip over the entire thing with one finger, pushing above where the legs meet the support pole. It's wobbly.The backdrops are thin. You'll notice you can see light through them as soon as you start unfolding them. This was noted in many reviews, and I am okay with it, as I shoot against a solid white wall that has no light behind it. Factoring this in though, I have to wonder... The light construction of the drop stand is attributed to \"ease of portability\" and yet, the sheets are so thin that they need to be against a dark, solid wall. Seems the entire set was not engineered. The backdrops have the texture of cheap sheets and the creases associated with it. Products sit and settle as they're in inventory which I have no issue with. I would expect that after several days spread out, the creases would disappear. They did not, lending more to the feel of overly starched cheap sheets.The umbrellas are similarly cheap. I would be SHOCKED to learn that these umbrellas were designed for photography, rather than picked because the colors suit photography. By comparison, with this set I also purchased a pair of gold reflecting umbrellas for about $7 each and they're leaps and bounds better than these in terms of construction.The CFLs included in this set are the best part of it. They're brilliantly white and put out quite a bit of light. That said, so do $3 CFLs from the local hardware store. I know, because they're actually the same color temperature I've been buying in CFL for years from Home Depot and they compare very well. Test shots under my normal home CFLs and these are nearly identical.Pairing the lights with the umbrellas is disappointing. First, the CFLs are large and spread light in every direction rather than directing it. The smaller CFLs I mentioned from the hardware store are actually better, as the smaller surface of the tube directs light to the umbrella better and bleeds less ambient light into the room. Unfortunately, the gossamer umbrella material fails here too as it's thin enough to bleed light as well.The kit also came with a bag. I haven't actually used the bag, so I have nothing bad to say about it. I'm sure I will, given time.

(peak and red recording lights turn off)Immediate Recording (Setup and Start):  The cheaper units go through an \"Initialization phase\" when you hit the record button.  The R-05 is immediate.  When you press the REC button, it automatically pauses for level adjustments and start of song queueing.Options: Too many to list; Very well done and well thought out for recording live instruments / voice / etc.Sensitivity and Direction  I noticed pattern that I could use to dampen back group (audience) sounds.  This is useful when your primary interest is the music.Power Saving Features:  Lights can be turned off automatically when you want to conserve power.Ease of Use: Very simple and easy to use.. Well thought out interface.Cons:V1.03 is required to use NI-MH batteries.. If you have V1.02, it will show the battery is dead within an hour of use.  After the update, I have tested it so far for 3 hours recording with 1 bar drop..The aluminum case is only a shell, it is mostly plastic with what amounts to a phone case around it.  If it is dropped, it will respond like plastic so don't drop it.While corners were cut to bring a very good recorder to be affordable at this price point, I would highly recommend the R-05 to anyone who wants a recorder that works exactly as advertised.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is it, a real recorder done right..", "unixReviewTime": 1349395200, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2012"}

Yi", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewText": "I'd never pay $200 for an overpriced Sony battery grip, but this knockout copy is not an alternative as described below.  I like consumer friendly priced item, but designer need to think little harder before sending it to full production; and it shouldn't cost too much for a manufacture to make a decent yet a functional part.  Why can't they just copy everything from Sony?First, its manual states to remove battery grip when camera is not to be used for an extended period.  This really baffles me.  Is the manufacturer not that knows to create excessive battery leakage?  For any electronics device, I have never seen anything like this, advising user to remove battery when not in use.  That's what the switches are for, to functionally isolate and disconnect a needless power drain.Second, Battery door locking latch is too loose, makes it prone to slide inadvertently.  The memory compartment on Sony camera implements a similar mechanism; but Sony's door snaps and locks tight in the place, unlike this one.  On can always tape and re-tape the door area every time battery door is accessed, but that is outright ridiculous.Third, they should have provided the some kind of lugs on the side for the hand grip.  Without it, one must use the external bracket tied to a tripod mount, which make it awkward if not impossible to hold the camera vertically, while adding unnecessary mass and weight to camera.Lastly, on the bottom of Sony camera, there a little provisional hole on the opposite side of battery slot, conceivably to provide necessary alignment of the grip with the camera chassis while preventing unintended torque of the grip in case of mishap.  This feature is not implemented in this grip.My observation from further testing:Unless I received a totally defective unit, this one doesn't seem to implement a switching circuit, an algorithm to allow sequentially draw of power from one battery and then switch to another one, once the first one is completely discharged.  This to me is a critical feature connecting two batteries for an electrical isolation.  This probably explains why manufacturer wants user to remove the battery from the holder when camera is not in use.It's a serious design flaw, hooking up two batteries in parallel without a minimal protective feature.  This will force each battery in continuous charging/discharging mode regardless of status of main switch.  Consequently, it will severely degrade battery's useful life.It's only my assumption based on my quick testing, but if it turns out to be true, I wouldn't put this thing nowhere near my camera even if someone pays me to use this part.Do not claim 100% compatibility, if not meant to be.

For the most part, it looks classy.  Then, on the inside, they inserted a cut out with a tan and brown ad for the company....  It's far from subtle, doesn't match the color scheme of the case, looks like a business card stuck in the case, and, in my opinion cheapens the case.  This may be perceived as a nit, but to me it's very objectionable.  I'm providing detail, since I tried to figure out what this was on the photos, and couldn't decide what it was.

This is a much more comfortable angle for viewing and typing when you have it on your lap while sitting on the couch. However, the insert device is not really set up for this configuration and the flap sometimes slips out. 3) The outlet at the bottom where you insert the plug for recharging could be a bit wider.

I previously owned a \"pro-sumer\" Fuji which I loved but it was a bit clunky (bulky) to keep at the ready and heavy to pack and haul around. Plus the technology (2002) was becoming dated. I bought this Lumix model about 18 months ago (Aug 2010) and was initially pleased. Drawback was mainly too many features and I was overwhelmed and confused by the menu. It did not help that there was no included manual and that I had to download a 180 page pdf for print out.Then there was the problem that it only takes jpg formats; there is not a raw or tiff format option so I needed to set up a workflow during import so that I could convert the images to an archive stable format.Today's exasperation has me searching for a replacement camera. This is the 3rd time in the last 4 months that it did not recognize the SD card. The first time I replaced it and gave the original SD card to my daughter. That original SD card still works flawlessly in her Kodak camera. The second time I fiddled with it a bit, gave up and saved my images to the Internal Memory. Then, magically, a few weeks later, it suddenly recognized the SD card again.This third time, after working fine all day, it suddenly went to Internal Memory Only on a capture. I knew it was nearly full (1.8 out of 2 GB on the SD card) so I hooked it up to my computer. To my surprise, only the 6 images captured to the Internal Memory showed up on my computer!Anxiously I fiddled with reinserting the SD card a few times and then decided to place the SD card into my Wii. Thankfully all the photos showed up. Next I put the SD card into my husband's computer (his has a card reader) and once again they showed up. He moved them over to a USB for me but when I re-inserted the SD card into the Lumix it decided to recognize the SD card again and all the photos displayed both on the camera LCD and through my computer's USB camera connection.I then went online and discovered quite a few posts in various forums describing this same behavior. The sporadic nature of the camera being unable to recognize or access the SD card is quite frustrating. The forum suggestions to blow compressed air inside the slot, clean the points with alcohol, try a new card and turn it on/off did not work for myself or the others.I want a camera that I can rely on to capture photos and it's not this model!

Perfect for anyone looking to upgrade the standard 360 wired set. A few minor concerns keep it from a full five stars.LONG REVIEW: When I went looking for a new wired headset for XBox Live (I have surround sound, so I didn't need a set with built-in speakers), the Turtle Beach brand and fairly reasonable price caught my attention. Then, I started reading reviews. It seems about 33% to 50% of people who bought these headsets claimed they stopped working within days or weeks. I decided to tempt fate (I mean, everything breaks at some point) and fall back on the one-year warranty that all electronics have.Over a full month later, I can safely report the XC1 is still fighting the good fight. I have had no problems with it whatsoever.The headset itself is rather nice. The headrest is firm and flexible, with a faux-leather pad so the top of your head doesn't get sore and a grippy foam pad on the non-speaker side to keep it from falling off your head. The ear cup is generously large and should do any age range's ears fine as long as you're not an elephant; I particularly like the cup's padding which is cloth instead of faux leather. Sound quality is decent, a step up from the Microsoft base model. The really nice feature is the adjustable mic, which holds whatever shape you feel like putting it in, and rotates to various positions, including backwards, to make it a left-ear or right-ear design as needed. The cord is a decent length, has a standard volume and mute/on toggle, capped off by a jack that will fit the 360 controller, with or without the text pad attachment.So what's holding me back from five stars? Three little things.1.) Volume: Although I don't want my ears hurt by chatter, I was surprised that even on \"max\" volume, the XC1 is not appreciably louder than the Microsoft base model.2.) The mute/on toggle: Since it's going to dangle out of both your field of vision and the controller, you might lose a precious second here or there making sure the mic is on or off. If you're the kind of gamer who leaves their mic on all the time so other players can hear you cough and breathe, this should not be an issue.3.) The ear cup has two large cutaways that promise to \"let game sound in\". I'm not sure of it's my ears or head size, but whatever ear I have covered is not going to get nearly the same volume levels from my speakers as my uncovered ear. After a session, there's a noticeable difference between ears to ambient sounds levels. The culprit is the speaker pad, which is large and raised, so the cup might have holes but your ear is going to be covered by the speaker.In sum, a good upgrade from the standard 360 kit. I will report back if (and when) the XC1's decide to stop working, but so far, so good.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A Good Upgrade from the Standard 360 Wired Headset", "unixReviewTime": 1337212800, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2012"}

Overall they are well balanced and have plenty of air/space in the high registers as well as plenty of bass (including for rock) at the other end of the register. Here are a few subjective impressions (for what they are worth): The horns in Sibelius' Finalandia are crisp and clear with lots of space around them, giving a very dynamic impression. Equally the strings are deep and dynamic in the opening of Mahler's 2nd (not quite like LP though). In the last loud movement of Shostakovich's 11th symphony the whole orchestra is well defined, the beats precise, and the sense of space between the instruments is truly impressive (again for such a little speaker). Despite their small size they can fill a reasonable large room. My office is 4x6 metres, but they are sufficient for even larger rooms, would say 6x8 or maybe slightly larger. If you need a speaker for parties with loud music look for larger speakers (and the quality matters less). If you look for a really good musical reproduction for your desk look no further.

Shortly later, after recording numerous high density videos I ran out of space.  Since it was more than 30 days since I had my Tivo, Tivo refused to allow me to swap out my player for an upgrade or put in another hard drive, other than buying another whole new Tivo!.I considered simply adding an external hard drive built specifically for Tivo, a simple fix (by the way, Tivo charges about twice what you can get them from Amazon, etc).  However, since I am familiar with computers and after reading how the external drives seem not hold up so well in the long run and how you might loose the programs stored on both the main drive and the external if it ever dysfunctions or you disconnect the external hard drive, I decided to just have one larger drive inside the Tivo with more recording capability.I searched on line and in the Tivo forums found that upgrading my Tivo Premiere XL would be easy and that I could increase my recording potential from 150 Hrs with the 1 TB drive in it to 300HD hours with a 2 TB WD20EURS drive (already maximized with reliability, power saving and compatible functions for Tivo and Video recording - 3 Yr Warranty).  All I needed to do was copy the contents of my current 1 TB Tivo which is already a WD10EURS to 2 TB using a Western Digital WD20EURS Hard Drive as the target drive.  By the way,  Tivo software at present WILL NOT support a 3TB drive, so do not buy one of those.To do that, I found a reference to a program called JMFS, rev 104 in Tivo forums after a Yahoo internet search.  I downloaded it, and and when I clicked on the download, I was given the option of burning the disk which I did creating a boot cd with the JMFS program on it.I then repeatedly hit F2 as my computer was starting to change the boot order to CD Rom before hard disk (change this back to hard drive when done with the copy procedure). I unplugged my Tivo, then using a Torx T10 and T15 screwdriver (purchased at Ace or online), I removed the four screws to the Tivo cover and then slid back the cover to my Tivo, and being careful not to touch anything else inside (possible shock), I removed the current Tivo hard drive which has four Torx screws holding the rail inside .  I then inserted the JMFS boot drive into my computers second CD drive and turned OFF my computer, opened the side of my computer and disconnected the power and sata belt to my computers main hard drive (leave the computers hard drive in the machine) and then connected the power and SATA plugs freed up inside my computer from disconnecting the hard drive(s) in the machine to both the old Tivo drive taken out of my Tivo and the new 2 TB drive I am copying to.  (hard drives now sitting on floor both connected next to computer).  I then started the machine allowing my computer to start and boot up from the JMFS boot disk in the CD Rom.  The program showed me both the older smaller Tivo Drive and the Newer Larger Drive and then gave me the option to copy from the smaller to the larger (make sure that you have this right), and after the copy finished (about 3-4 hours), I was given the option to expand my new drive to 2 TB for tivo, and then to supersize which only took about one second each.Done!  Nothing else needed to be done since the WD20EURS is already optimized to work with Tivo (no need to worry about parking or seek speeds or running the Wdidle program).  I simply put the new drive into my Tivo, and now it says 320 Hrs of HD recording available.Naturally, to make my computer usable again, I turned it off and  disconnected the Tivo Drives, and reconnected my hard drive power and sata belts, and started my computer hitting F2 again to access the setup and bios program and changed back the order of the boot to hard drive first.Note, that the WD20EURS needs to be aligned if instead of puting it into a Tivo or video recorder you leave it inside your computer running with Windows XT in place unless you align the hard drive first (a jumper setting), however, this is not a problem setting up a tivo drive as the JMFS boot disk that you made has its own operating system that you use when you boot and the fact that windows XT might be on your computer is totally irrelevant to the copy procedure.  So don't worry about windows XT being on your computer for this copy procedure and don't add a jumper or alter or align the WD20EURS when you get it!If I had known I was going to buy an upgrade drive, I probably would have purchased the $400 Tivo Premiere XL4 machine (cheaper on Amazon) with 300 HD hours already available and the ability to record four channels at a time instead of 2 channels and only 150 HD recording hours like the Tivo Premiere XL.  By the way, you can get a refurbished Premiere XL from Tivo with 150 HD hours for $150 at present.  And of course, it may be wise to save the old Tivo drive removed as a backup should your new drive ever fail or to put in the machine for a factory return if you need service later.The instructions to do this upgrade may be slightly different for an older version than a Tivo Premiere, however, they are readily available on the internet.  If you are not confident about doing this and are out of space, the external drive may be a much better option for you.Of course, a computer shop or hard drive cloner tool may be able to clone your Tivo Drive onto the larger drive.  However, you may still need to run the JMFS boot disk to expand the new drive to the full 300Hrs recording time and supersize (for another 20 hours) the disk and if you have less than a Premiere machine, you may need to use a different program to supersize (instructions on line).The new drive does not invalidate the ownership of your Tivo, which is recognized from a microchip in the machine.  Also, this process works fine with a machine with Windows XP as mentioned since you are using the Unix Operating system on the JMFS boot disk.  My drive although bulk OEM, was easily recognized and used for the copying of my older drive to the new.  Other drives may work for this procedure, but the WD20EURS is an AV drive optimized to conserve its resources when not being used and to be more reliable in the long run.As a side note, Comcast in our area only broadcasts at 720dpi even in high definition.  When I set my Tivo to record higher than that, the picture looked terrible, some sort of bad upsampling apparently.  So, if you don't like your picture, try setting your tivo for recording at 720 dpi.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WD20EURS is the Drive to Get to Upgrade Your Tivo Hard Drive", "unixReviewTime": 1354147200, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2012"}

For reference, I used this product with my Canon 5D Mark III and 24-105L combo.Pros:1.) The construction of the 263AT tripod is great. The legs open easily, and it's great to be able to turn the stem 90 degrees for those low shots. It's got a nice weight to it so it won't fall over.2.) The padding on the legs will prevent against the legs scratching each other up. It also means the legs aren't freezing cold/boiling hot when you handle them!3.) The SBH-100 ball head is a great, very portable head. It's very, very smooth. Another reviewer said they had to lubricate the head to make it smooth, but mine was silky smooth out of the box. You shouldn't have to do any DIY to make this work. It locks excellently, and I had NO fear with my expensive setup attached to the head.Cons:1.) You need a coin to tighten the tripod mount piece to your camera. Other heads on the market (including some of Vanguard's) have a D-shaped ring to tighten this piece down, so it's a shame the SBH-100 isn't one of them. Not the end of the world - just keep a coin on you!2.) The finish on the SBH-100 isn't perfect (at least mine isn't). Just some minor imperfections toward where you connect it to the tripod.Overall, though, this is a very solid combination. I've actually used the SBH-100 head with my carbon fiber Vanguard Alta Plus 225CT.

It isn't.  It doesn't spin fast enough for that and the blades are harmless.  However, it puts out a surprising amount of air flow.  Note, however, the airflow is not tremendous.  In this small of a form, you're not going to get tons of air.  So, don't expect that.  However, I'm giving this fan 5 stars because it does exactly what it claims and it does it well.  It's also packaged nicely and it arrived timely.  Some other reviewers have stated that it's hard to adjust while it's spinning.  Yes, if you try grabbing the fan by the gooseneck, you're likely to get hit by the spinning blades.  No, they don't hurt as they don't spin that fast, it's just a little startling.However, to adjust this fan, it's very simple.  Pinch the center of the fan between the back and the front to stop the blades from spinning.  You have to straddle the spinning fan in that space between your thumb and index finger.  It might take a few practice tries, but it's really easy.  Once you pinch the fan, the blades stop.  Then adjust the fan how you need it. Release and the fan spins again. It's actually quite simple. It also makes it simple to unplug the fan.  Stopping the fan in this way doesn't hurt it for small adjustments.Now, the amazing thing about this fan is that it's nearly noiseless.  I've had other small desk fans and they always have a certain degree of noise and rattle.  This one has nearly none.

It -will- work with AF and old manual lenses, but not well.Here's why: it doesn't play well with anything with an aperture ring.  I find that if you combine this with a lens with an aperture ring and haven't stopped it all the way down, the larger tab on the aperture ring may press on the lens release lever of the adapter.  I suspect that many of the reviews of this adapter that say it won't open the aperture full are a result of this issue.  If the lens is not fully mounted onto this adapter, sure enough, you won't be able to open the iris all the way.  Properly attached, the following lenses work through their full aperture range: 20/mm Sigma, 35/2D Nikon, 50/1.4G Nikon, 85/1.8D Nikon, 70-200/2.8 Nikon, 17-55/2.8.I'll reiterate: make sure you have the lens' aperture ring stopped down and the lens fully mounted to the adapter, or else the aperture may not function properly and the lens may come off the adapter.Other than issues with non-G lenses, this absolutely behaves as one would expect.I'd give this five stars except for one real issue: the aperture adjustment ring built into this adapter does not move smoothly.  It's operation is a bit jerky, and you will notice this lack of smoothness if you adjust it while shooting video.  However, even if it could be done smoothly, adjusting the aperture during video can be jarring, so this is a non-issue to me.  I have not compared this to other models of adapter.I've used this with some sizable/heavy lenses and I feel pretty confident about the build.  There is no slop on either rotation or perpendicular to the plane of focus.  At least that I could discern.  I have two and feel they're indistinguishable from one another.

Obviously this monitor is a fraction of the price of \"brand\" models out there, which is a plus, and it included a screen hood and chargeable battery pack.The menu control system on the monitor takes a bit to get used to, but it is not a deal breaker. One tip is to turn off all of the display info on your DSLR when using the monitor to shoot, this will provide you with the largest picture on the monitor. (When the display information shows, the image is cropped down to make room for the shot info; ISO, Shutter Speed, etc.) Also note that even when the display info on your DSLR is turned of, the video image won't fill up the entire screen, since this is a widescreen monitor and most DSLR's LCD screens are 4:3, not 16:9.Finally, you will need to need to dial in your monitor's color balance to match your camera. It took me about 20 minutes playing with the different color channels (red, green, blue) and the saturation.Overall, great screen at a fantastic price.

I also have the 24mm 1.4G and 85 1.4G which are all equally as impressive, but I find this 35mm focal length to be much more useful as an \"everyday\" lens.  35mm on a full frame body can pass as wide angle for landscapes and architecture as well as a portrait lens.  And because of its close focus ability, it serves as a semi-macro lens as well with about .2X magnification and close focusing to about 1 foot.  Background defocus is also more pronounced than the 24mm due to the focal length, and bokeh is almost as beautiful as the 85 1.4G.  I've used it on a D700 and now on a D800 and when I pixel peep the 36 megapixel file, I'm even more amazed at how sharp this lens is.  It's tack sharp wide open at f/1.4, which was not something I expected, so much so that any increase in sharpness when stopped down was only really noticeable near the edges upon close inspection.  Perhaps Nikon designed the optical formula to be this way?  If so, I applaud them because if you're going to spend $1600 on a big and heavy fast prime lens, you'd want to shoot it wide open, otherwise there's no point in carrying the extra bulk.I'm such a sucker for prime lenses that I've amassed a large of collection of Leica M primes, Zeiss, Voigtlander, Nikon, and Canon primes from new to older classics.  This 35mm has to be up there among my top 5.  The only sharper 35mm I've used is the latest version of the Leica M Summilux, but dare I say even that might not be as sharp wide as Nikon's at f/1.4.  And this 35mm is certainly in the same class as the sharpness king in my collection: the Zeiss 100mm Makro-Planar ZF.2.  But it's not about sharpness that makes this lens great.  It's about usability.  This is the lens that I'd likely keep if I could only have one, or bring with me if I could only carry one, simply because it can used for almost any type of shot.  While it doesn't focus as fast as any of Nikon's pro zooms, it's fast enough for most purposes and that includes focus tracking fast moving subjects like kids or pets.  On the D800, continuous AF works well and is often spot-on.So what are the cons?  There are very few but I'll list them: 1) AF motor is somewhat noisy (sounds cheap and even noisier than my copies of the 24mm and 85mm 1.4G) when the the lens is hunting for focus, 2) it's somewhat large and overly heavy for a regular prime (though nicely balanced and doesn't seem as large when mounted on a D800 or D4), and 3) the filter size is 67mm (why oh why did Nikon do this?  The 24mm 1.4G is almost identical in barrel size, form, and overall dimensions and that lens uses the 77mm filter thread that most of the modern Nikon pro lenses use, so why 67mm for the 35?  Does not compute).  Despite these things, I'm still giving this lens 5 stars because they are far from deal-breakers and doesn't change the fact that I really love this lens.Get one for your FX Nikon body today, you will love it.  But if you shoot with a DX body, save your money and get the excellent 35mm f/1.8 DX version instead.  The 1.4G version is expensive, big, and heavy and its optical advantages are only really exploited by a full frame sensor.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Phenomenal Lens!

Like many buyers I chose to ignore the negative reviews. My first purchase with the camera was the kit with 18-105mm lens. After hundreds of shots, only about 15% of them were sharp. I thought the problem were the lens. So, I returned the kit and bought a D7000 body, along with Nikkor 105mm f/2.8G micro and 85mm f/1.8G prime lenses.After testing the new camera body with two new prime lenses, I discovered there was a serious back-focusing problem with the camera. The AF Fine Tuning feature in the camera is quite good. However, I needed to adjust -15 for the 105mm and -4 for the 85mm. Then again, the AF Fine Tuning does not solve all the focusing problems. Depending on the shooting distance, I would have to calibrate the AF again and again. So, the calibration is hit-and-miss.Having trusted Nikon for 30 years, I believed I just had a bad batch twice in a row and I should still have a good chance of getting a good copy. So, I returned the camera again got another copy a few days later. To my dismay, same serious back-focusing problem still exist in the new camera. Then I did some digging in Amazon review (paying attention to the negative ones this time) and Googled more discussion forums to see if I am not alone.  Sure enough, many people had reported the same problem dated back in July 2011.So, I returned the camera again and decided not to try another one.In all fairness, I like the features the camera offers. The body is very responsive. The AF accuracy with the LCD Live View is extremely high (though very slow). However, the Phase-Detect AF system is a complete disappointment.The best thing I got out of this experience is the knowledge I gained from testing AF and fine tuning it. So much information is available on Amazon and photo forums on this subject.  If you own a mid-range camera like D7000, you owe it to yourself to learn how to test and calibrate your camera with your lens collection. Based on my experience, having tried 3 copies without success, it's fair to me to give it a 1-star rating. A camera that cannot focus is not a usable camera on my book.  I will probably wait for the new Nikon cameras coming out this fall (if rumors are right).With this writing, I am hoping all the buyers of this camera (or any camera) thoroughly test their cameras AS SOON AS they receive them. Do not wait until 30 days pass and you have to send them back to Nikon for service. If you pay for a new precise instrument, you expect it to work out-of-box. I chose not to send a brand new camera to Nikon for calibration because it's brand new! Plus, some people have reported same focusing problem even AFTER Nikon service center told them their cameras have been repaired. I am glad I did not need to go through that.Hope this is helpful.

So, if you like to wear headphones for a long time, these may not be for you. The sound really is so great, otherwise I would have dropped it down more.I have heard a lot of headphones and I have heard a lot of in-ear buds, and while most sound good when you plug them into your computer, these Diesel headphones are superb, especially plugged into my sound system! Even without a high-end system, you will hear things you wouldn't normally hear. The words will be a little clearer, the highs a little sharper and the bass a little stronger. Putting the diesel through its paces was a real pleasure. I should mention that this is really a 4.5 star product, for reasons I will mention, but I bumped it to 5 stars because I feel that it has enough to go over the top. Let me get the little negatives out of the way. The cord is a little too short I would like to have had it another foot longer. Not a big thing, but still, it would make a difference. The real issue is that the padding does not fully cover my ears. I don't know if that is good or bad, but I currently do not like it. If the actual headphones were a little bigger I think it would be more comfortable and also provide a better experience.....the thing is it might also get your ears a lot hotter.

I have a very expensive PC build with all solid parts, but the audio from the m-board is still a bit bland. I'm not too much into gaming these days but listens to a lot of music on my Klipsch 2.1 speakers as I work. I was a bit skeptical about how much will this card improve over my $300 m-board on-board audio since on-board sounds already fine. Until I got it installed and fired up Pandora ONE's 192kbps tracks, wow was I amazed. The mids and treble clarity are truly different and the bass is more accurate and tuned. I can hear the detailed difference.The integrated headphone amp will drive up to about 120ohms with good clarity on 60+ohms mode with decent volume, but higher impedance pairs will start to lose fidelity. So if you are a hardcore audiophile, this is probably not your card, the Xonar Essence ST will do it for you.There is only one drawback with this card I can think of, it is the build quality. Every other component in my PC have all high quality solid capacitors/parts with precision soldering points the eye can see, but this sound card does not. I can see micro resistors and capacitors mounted on almost sideways but still functioning. I'm not sure if this quality control issue would cause problems down the road or not, but so far this card functions flawlessly with no noise in sound production.I would recommend this card to anyone looking for tremendously better PC sound without forking out too much!

Maybe I was late, missing Woot's $99 deal and also not hearing about those T-amps from Sonic, but am back, digging out my CD's and my old Sony amp and an old Marantz (not from the 70's) integrated amp.  Maybe, it's reading Reina and Guttenberg and Meija rant on Stereophile.  I even found my old 5 inch Polk speakers- they had a 20 year old layer of crap all over the drivers which I couldn't even remove completely.  The Polks hurt my ears after 5 minutes, sounding very crisp and sharp, but very detailed.  I looked online for something cheap and good.  Online, people rave about Energy speakers, but I also missed the CB-5 $79 deal (and good thing I did).  So, I kept reading and listening to the Polks.  I also had a pair of Teac 4 inch kevlar speakers sounding very detailed, but having no mid bass.  So I kept reading...  Then, last month I missed Newegg's $99 deal on the 51 floor standers.  I was so mad, but I didn't want clutter, so I went to look at the BS41 bookshelf speakers.  It seems like they have been discontinued by apparently pricing themselves too low, so low that retailers are afraid people will compare them with an upper line of speakers.  Well, I had to audition everything within the ballpark and have this to say:  The BS41s are a great, easy listening, realistic, wall of sound.  I auditioned B&W 685s, 686s, Energy CB5s, CB10s, CB20s, low end Martin Logans, Magnepans- albeit in a not so great closed room full of speakers.  The Pioneers have a more cohesive lows-mid-highs to them.  They don't sound crispy, but realistic like wood instruments sound like wood and string instruments have the right twang.  Vocals sound present and not shouty, but not lip smacking detailed.  With my Marantz int amp, the bass is round and full, being even, but with a small T-amp, the mids and highs dominate.  Both those amps sound smooth as butter.  I remember the first old days of my old Sony CD changer when sound was so accurate and ear piercing, making you wonder why it hurt to listen to CD's.  MP3's streaming from my PC to Iphone or directly from the Iphone are clear, but you can tell that CD's sound more dynamic.  Unplugged Eric Clapton's, \"Tears from Heaven\" sounds live and wide.  To me, Energy's are too crispy unreal like oversharped LCD 1080P Bluray movies.  B&W's 685, the vocals seem like they are delaye and way behind the speaker and hollow, but the sound is fuller than the 686's, which have a better vocal feel, but lack midbass.  Those high tech MLs and Magepans remind me of the titanium JBL speakers from the 80's like smacking a thin tin can, super accurate and, sounding like a tin can.  These Pioneer speakers are even, not superdetailed in the vocals, but easy to listen to for longer sessions of enjoying your music.  I'm guessing they can tolerate anything from a sharp accurate amp to a warm amp because they are so smooth sounding.  Some notes:  They are fairly large \"bookshelf\" speakers, more like a 685 than a 686.  The grills are permanent and very subtle, making you focus on the music not on whether or not they sound better with their grills on or off.  Their bird eye's view look like Wharfedales, not some old boxy speakers.  I wish I got them at the Woot price, but I would hate to miss such a great little speaker for 2 channel music or a small setup for watching movies because they reproduce a wide soundstage that sounds realistic.  With vocals smack in the center, I wonder if I would need a center.  A sharper sounding set may impress some people more for movies. This is a great set of speakers for people who want to listen to music for music's sake and not need a sub for movies or anything like that.  Add a great old cd player, a small amp (T-amp or old Marantz) and these speakers are a little bit of fun in a world full of schedules, diapers, car maintenance, bringing out the garbage, doing laundry.

The solo's have a lot I mean a lot of bass which isn't a bad thing but can give you a minor headache if you listen to them to long.  The Bose ae2's in my opinion deliver the perfect amount of bass and does not distort the sound quality whatsoever.  After having my Solo's break at the top headband part even with the reinforced headbands and they broke with very gentle use, I moved on to the studios.  For the amount I paid for these headphones I was very disappointed.  There was a buzzing almost staticy noise whenever you turned them on.  After I sent them back to monster they replaced them and the noise was still there.  After I sold the studios I heard about the Bose ae2's and how they were very nice and delievering headphones.  After a couple of days debating whether to get the ae2i's or the ae2's I decided to go with the ae2s because I was not paying for a microphone for 30 dollars and I'm pretty sure u can just buy the cable.  Well anyways the sound is amazing!!  The first time I ever put them on I swear I had an eargasm and don't even get me started on the comfort after 10 minutes of having them on u will forget they were even there.  Oh and even though they don't say they are noise cancelling when u have the volume at 50 percent u can barely hear anything else.

The vertical tracking adjustment makes it easy to set up for a variety of different cartridges. Tracking force and anti-skating adjustments are easily accomplished. A holder for a spare headshell (sold separately) and a 45 rpm adapter (included) are nice touches. Although the unit has a strobe, the speed is not adjustable. It has a built-in preamp, which can be toggled on and off using a switch on the back of the base. This is handy if you're using an amplifier or receiver without a phono input. A USB port is also included for connection to a PC. As with most turntables, stylus overhang adjustment is the most difficult part of the setup. There are several good web sites describing the procedure, so if you're in doubt just do a web search. Note that the LP240 doesn't come with a cartridge, so you'll need to choose one yourself. I'm currently using an old Shure V15 Type IV (out of production) with a new stylus, and it sounds pretty good on my audio system. Take a look at the Shure M97xE. It's a great cartridge for about $80-90.I have mixed feelings about this turntable, because I wanted a multi-purpose deck - one with a USB output so I could bypass my PC sound card when digitizing some LPs, but also good enough quality to use on my audio system. The specs on the unit are just OK, but I was willing to live with that to get USB. However, I've been disappointed; I was unable to get enough signal from the USB port to make good recordings. I also can't get sufficient output from the analog outputs when I connect to the Line In on my PC. I even tried using a USB sound card with the analog connections, but simply can't get a strong signal. (I have had success with an old Sanyo TT, so I have to suspect the LP240.) The only way I was able to make recordings was by using the Mic In port on the PC, and setting the input level to max. I haven't heard of anyone else with this problem though.For everyday use, the LP240 has decent sound. My main turntable is a Technics SL-1200 MK3D, which definitely sounds better than the Audio Technica. I have no doubt that Amazon would have allowed me to return the LP 240, but I decided to keep it. It's a good quality piece of equipment, and it should last a long time. So it'll make a nice backup, and gives me a place to play some LPs that aren't in the best shape. If you're looking for something around $500 to use as your primary turntable, shop around and compare - you might just settle on the AT LP240.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Mixed Feelings", "unixReviewTime": 1326758400, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2012"}

I'm using a Galaxy S 2 from AT&T; (so, the i777 version) and my card was force-wiped this morning. No issues to indicate a failure would happen - no dropping the phone, no exposing it to water, nothing. It just decided to stop working (or Android is mis-diagnosing the card, but who can tell).I've wiped the card using Android's format option, but I don't think that has accomplished much other than getting rid of my files. It occurred too quickly for me to believe it's doing a proper wipe and locating bad sectors. I don't know whether the flash file system stores things in a special way, but my guess is that it didn't actually do a full format.Bottom line, do what other people are saying and buy a slightly slower card, you're most likely not going to use the 1080p recording option as often as you think you are. The high speed isn't worth the hit in reliability.Other notes: The reader is flimsy-ish, but works as advertised.

But, I can report that after purchasing my Drobo S nearly six months ago it has worked brilliantly for me every day.

It was not a serious problem, but annoying enough for me to experiment with replacing my adapter. After replacing the USB 3 adapter with a superior Western Digital model, the problems have been vanquished. This speaks to the fact that for a Drobo S to perform best it needs quality companion components.The Drobo S has a power-saving mode that puts it to sleep if it's not actively being used.

It is not loud and it is a pleasant-enough white noise, but it's noise nonetheless. I would prefer a quieter solution.Quality Western Digital drives were purchased for use in my Drobo S, and this has proved an excellent choice as well.

I mean if I turn off my PS3 and Xbox the monitor sets it self to sleep VIA HDMI!!! Unlike my Asus VH242H. With the Asus it would stay on, with a blue screen and never turn off unless you get up and turn it off manually. I'm lazy so if I'm in bed I'd have to get up before I went to sleep unless I wanted the sky lighting up my room. The Asus went to sleep with DVI which was fine but just wanted to let you know this HP monitor sleeps on HDMI. Also if the monitor is sleeping with no devices turn on, the monitor will auto switch inputs if you turn on your PS3 or PC so you don't have to press any buttons. It does it automatically for you. The screen is WIDE! and very nice.That's about the only pros I have with this monitor. Here we go with the Cons.You can only set one custom video settings. So if you like multiple settings for either gaming, movies, photo editing then you'll have to go in the menu and change the settings each time you switch from movie to gaming or to photo editing. It's not difficult but for a $300 monitor you should be able to change default settings and save them under their names. The Asus was able to do that and it's half the price.There is no saturation setting. The monitor gives you a \"color\" option which is just setting the warmness of the monitor. Either it be standard (6500k), RGB (customizable), warm (5000k), and cool (9300k). The colors of the monitor are very flat and not vibrant/vivid which I prefer.The blacks are more black, the whites are more white then my Asus but I prefer the Asus blacks because they're lighter. You can see different shades of blacks better on clothing in movies, and objects in shadows in video games. You can notice it in Minecraft inside the ground with no lighting. You can see better in the dark with the Asus.The backlight bleeding is outrageous. I put the brightness down to 20% and the bleeding never goes away. The left side and bottom are the worse. The entire screen is hazey in pitch black scenery. Say if a video transitions from a commercial back to the program, that 3 seconds of black are grey. Happens on everything I watch. Sometimes it looks dark blue to purple if it's black long enough.Follow up: I set the Dynamic Contrast Ratio to on (really should be off at least on hdtv's) but the way this works is once the screen shows a darker image, the monitor dims down. This helps tremendously on the backlight bleeding.

I just wanted to step up the sound to the next level but didn't want to spend a fortune. When I saw the VF-36's on sale for $198.00 I jumped on it. Wow! What a difference! I love the sound of the Quintet SL's but these just put those to shame. I knew that the VF-36's would sound better but I did not expect this big of a difference. I replaced the rear double speaker SL's (1 woofer; 1 tweeter) with the front triple speaker SL's (2 woofer; 1 tweeter) and put the VF-36's up front. I have a mid-range Yamaha RX-V467 5.1 receiver (which I also love) and the sound is outstanding. You could almost get away with not having a sub with these VF-36's if you are on a tight budget. The sub does give it that extra punch though. More important though is that the F36's just have a beautiful, crystal clear, clean sound to them. The treble is outstanding. I could clearly hear the tambourine in a song that I could not hear at all with SL's. They are very heavy and quite attractive as well. Only complaint is that the cover cannot be removed. The top cover for the tweeter is magnetic and can be removed but not the cover for the bottom. This seems strange for such a high end speaker.

Baer \"Steve\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I have been playing with my new Asus Transformer Infinity TF700 Android (Jelly Bean 4.1.1) Tablet for about a month now and love it. I love the 4 row on-screen keyboard that includes number keys always present in the main mode. It makes entering data and phone numbers much easier than on my 3 row Ipad.But when I write a longer email or memo, I still long for a real keyboard. Hence, I began a search for a reasonably priced, well rated, lightweight travel keyboard that I might use occasionally. I devoted the better part of a Sunday afternoon to surfing the web looking for alternatives. I looked at many Bluetooth keyboards and folio case combinations, but they were too bulky and/or too expensive to meet my goal. But, after a while, I began to notice an interesting keyboard that went by several names at several prices, but appeared to be the same device. I even found a Youtube video showing someone installing and using it. [...]The reviews I read about it were favorable by a large percentage. Best of all, it was under $20 and available from Amazon. (I usually find that when something is on Amazon and has accumulated a few dozen favorable reviews over a period of months, that there is a good chance that it is not a shoddy product.) Anyway, at under $20 delivered, it was worth taking a chance.This keyboard is sold under various names including Sanoxy and Anker. Mine was advertised as a Sanoxy Blutooth Keyboard for Ipad - at a cost of $13.50. (I have seen it advertised for over $30 on some sites.) The box it came in had nether name, but it was the same device. The unit is all plastic, but looks and feels like a much, much higher priced Apple keyboard. It is advertised to have Apple function keys, but I did not test those, since my plan was to use it for my Android tablet.The keyboard arrived in about 3 days, and worked with my Android tablet directly out of the box. It runs on 2 AAA cells, which I prefer, since I did not want to have to discipline myself to recharge yet another device. (We shall see how long the batteries last, but at least it is easy to carry or buy spares.) The battery box underneath at the rear provides a nice wedge to hold the keyboard at a good typing angle.The unit arrived with no instructions, but I just followed the general Bluetooth mating steps for other devices, and it worked fine. (Especially after I remembered to un-mate the Android Tablet from another Bluetooth folio keyboard I have first!)  The keys are well spaced and have a very nice feel to them, with a silent click and a satisfying displacement. They work about as well as my main home computer keyboard. I would say that typing a several page memo on this would not be a chore at all. However, since the on-screen tablet keyboard is quite good for a few sentences of email, this unit will stay in my suitcase most of the time, only coming out when there is a lot of typing to do.Once the unit automatically mates with the tablet (takes a second or two), it is very response and follows my typing well. Some of the function keys (meant for Apple) also work on the Android tablet (e.g. home, media player controls, sleep). Others are still a mystery. As you can see from the Youtube video mentioned above, this keyboard can also mate with a phone.I just returned from a trip in which the keyboard (in the small but sturdy cardboard box that it comes packed in) bounced around various airplanes and waiting rooms for a week. Before writing this review, I just turned it on to check, and it mated and worked perfectly.I would say that this is a superb product, especially at the price,and can recommend it highly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wonderful!", "unixReviewTime": 1354060800, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2012"}

Meaning, to try to get a decent seal, I tried these with 6 additional brands of tips for ear buds, including some that fit me well on other models of ear buds I have.  These \"phones\" are just not worth $50 much less $250 (what I paid). I wish I was able to return them.  There is no dimension on which I'd recommend these. See point number 1 below for problems getting a good seal, including with all these other tips I have tried.* * *I have tried many brands of ear buds. I have a number of nice headphones (cans) as well, including the Bose top of the line noise canceling unit.  But that is so bulky to carry along on the plane that I finally decided to try some serious brand ear buds with noise canceling. Since sound is a matter of personal taste, I should note that I like clean, full sound that includes excellent bass response.  The latter is very important to me. So, if that is true of you, keep that in mind.1.  With ear buds like this, everything about sound quality is about if the rubber pieces seal your ear canal well. I could not find a combination of the included ones that sealed my ear canals ideally well. Part of the issue with these is that the stem that the rubber parts fit onto do not  extend as far out from the bulky part of the bud as other brands, and since the bulky part is, well, bulky, one cannot get these as well seated into the canal as ANY other type of sealing type bud I've ever tried.2. Partly as a function of the seal, but I think for additional reasons (you can tell what the sound would be if sealed great by pressing on them and listening a bit), I could not get very good base response out of these even when forcing the seal to be good.3. Again, partly as a function of the seal, but again, additional to it, I think (same test as above), the sound canceling ability of these is really low quality.  Inadequate. I have other ear buds of similar design that are not noise canceling and they block out more sound than these do.Summary. For me, a poorly performing, expensive set of ear buds from a solid company. Totally disappointing for me, anyway. The sound is not remotely as good as the Bose noise canceling cans. I'm back to thinking I just need to bite the bullet and carry more bulk and weight on airplanes. These Senn buds don't cut it for me. They sound no better and are not quieter than the $30 buds I got at Brookstone.  They sound far worse and do not suppress noise as well as the passive noise suppressing Klipsch model Si4.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Lousy bass, and not because of difficulty sealing canal", "unixReviewTime": 1332460800, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2012"}

It has pretty much the widest variety of connectors that I've seen on any cable tester.  There are two of each connector:  for each pair one is an \"output\" and one is an \"input\" connector.  Output connectors transmit a funny digital test signal, and the input connectors detect this signal and display the results (of which pins on one end of the cable are attached to which pins on the other) on the LED matrix.  You attach one end of a cable to any output connector and the other end to any input connector -- so you can have different connectors on each end of the cord.o You can test a cable with different connectors on the ends.o There is a row of \"intermittent\" LEDs next to the matrix.  You connect a cable, press the reset button, the wiggle the cable.  If any of the wires are intermittent the corresponding LED will light.  You can repeat this at will to track down a problem spot.o There is a built-in tone generator.  It generates a reasonably clean squarewave at either 440 or 1,000 Hz.  There's a slide switch that selects one of three volume levels, but the output levels are not quite correct:  The peak-to-peak output levels are: \"-50MIC\"=> 280mV (I think about 28mV would be more realistic),  \"-10dBV => 3.0V (should be 0.9V), +4dBu => 3.2V (this is about right).o There is a way to test for shorts in a cable.o There is a way to test cables where the far end can't be plugged into the tester:  you short pins on the other end then test for shorts.o The two pins on the side labeled \"SPEAKON\" are banana jacks, but are not the standard 3/4\" apart so can't be used for testing dual banana plugs.o The LED matrix can only test three pins at a time.  So if you are testing a cable with a plug that has more than three pins (e.g a MIDI or an ethernet plug) then there's a workaround:  The mysterious slide switch that is not described in the manual and whose positions are labeled \"SW1\", \"SW2\" and \"SW3\" is used for this.  The first position lets you test the first three pins of a connector, the second position lets you test the second three pins, and the third position lets you test the third set of three pins.o The LED matrix looks identical to the one on the Behringer CT100 cable tester.  The two units look identical except this one has way more connectors.  I can't believe but that they're the same design and made in the same factory, so I'd buy this one because it tests more connector types.o The instructions (which are printed on the box) don't mention that you need to install two AA batteries.o The box is painted steel, made with reasonable precision, with some scuff marks.  The PC boards inside are clean and well-soldered.  There are some mechanical hacks in the construction:  for example some of the connectors have plastic parts crudely trimmed off to fit, and the sliders of the slide switches have been partly clipped off to make them fit through the narrow, short slots through which they protrude.  I get the impression of these being built by a garage-type operation, but none of these things looks like they would affect reliability or longevity.  I'm confident this will be a rugged and long-lasting tool.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A good, capable, inexpensive cable tester", "unixReviewTime": 1350259200, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2012"}

Shocking, no?  Anyway, we asked around, read reviews, watched CNET, etc., and the choices came down to a Nikon 9100 or the Sony HX9V.  Because the Nikon was (at the time) $70 cheaper and we had the button issue with the H55, we went with the Nikon.  That was a terrible choice.  We played with it for 3 days, and for every \"decent to good\" picture you took (great seemed like a pipe dream), you took 5 terrible shots.  It was jittery, it had issues with focal points, lighting...everything about it sucked.  We're pretty good photographers, so it was very frustrating and surprising.

One thing to be careful about, though, are batteries.  We bought it with the expectation of reusing our H55 batteries, because the H55 and the HX9V use the same battery.

So, we're using the Sony battery that came with the H55 (that works, so I know it's not a form factor or voltage issue) and the Sony battery that came with the HX9V.

Nevertheless, as I have been following up the tablets and due to a sale on the Internet, ordered a Refurbished Thrive for a very inexpensive price.  It is a 32 GB model with the Tegra Dual Processor and all the thrills characteristic of the Toshiba brand.The Thrive is not the Tablet that Anne Hathaway will bring to the Manhattan office (if The Devil Wears Prada was filmed in 2012) but it's more a tablet that would be used in Iron Man or The Transformers.  It is heavier and bulkier than the Samsung Galaxys and the Ipads (due to the expansion capabilities) and replaceable back cover.  But it looks Avatar alike.The main reason I selected a Thrive vs the well rated Motorola and Asus counterparts was the expansion capacities.  These Thrive Tablets have things used commonly with other electronic devices; USB, Mini-USB, SD, HDMI, replaceable battery and a regular jack for charging, unlike the Ipads which use \"proprietary everything\" and accept nothing.  Even though I have had this device for a week only, have found some surprising positive features and decided to write this preliminary review.Have been running some tests and here are the initial results.  Battery life with Google Maps, the GPS on and some movie playing is from six to seven hours.  Recharge time is two hours with the factory charger.  The Wi-Fi connects immediately to the Router I use and the Honeycomb (3.2) Android system which is very simple to use as have had a Droid phone for over a year.  The Android Marketplace has now been replaced by Google Plus and the software provided by Toshiba has been surprisingly good.All the applications downloaded work on the Thrive although some (used on the phones) vary considerably when used in these larger devices.  Many of these are similar or identical to their counterparts in the OS Systems but limitations exist.  As of now, the most surprising thing has been the Toshiba Multimedia Player.  There has not been the need to install supplemental VLC or Real Players as the Toshiba does everything in an unanticipated way.Unlike other devices such as the Apple products, the Toshiba Player does play videos in multiple formats, including the classic Audio Video Interleave; AVI that dates from the beginnings of Windows in the early nineties.  This video format allows you to record and watch movies up to an extremely small compression factor and the Thrive plays them like the Creative Zens do, perfectly.The Zens were manufactured by Creative Labs from 2005 to 2007 and unlike the Zune and Ipods, they play every format you may want to record.  AVIs take grossly one fifth the space comparable to other formats.  Thus in a 32 GBs SD card you can store five times the number of movies you may store in an Ipod or Zune.  You will not have aspect / ratio issues as the Toshiba systems compensates for that as does in the Zens.The Thrives audio consists of two mini speakers on the bottom (if placed horizontally/landscape) which have a half an inch aperture on each side.  They can be loud but cannot reproduce the usual low frequencies from regular sized speakers.  But as there is a Bluetooth in these tablets, an external auxiliary larger speaker might help with the lack of bass.Internet capabilities are the typical Google ones; just start typing and you will get it.  MS-Word is being replaced by Google Docs but free software of \"Documents to Go\" allows you to access al Office features as long as they have been saved in the system.  Skype works perfectly but the tablet cameras are not the best.So far I am satisfied with my new toy and continue experimenting with video compression to evaluate how much can I load into a 32 or 64 GB card.  But, thinking of overriding the Honeycomb System and installing the Ice Cream one in the next month or so.  Let's see how it goes; more to come.

{"reviewerID": "A6FIAB28IS79", "asin": "B004KG1J3W", "reviewerName": "Samuel Chell", "helpful": [8, 10], "reviewText": "[Unlike some reviewers, I'm loathe to condemn Insignia for a technology that did not live up to expectations.  Insignia tried to make some creative uses of HD radio that larger manufacturers like Sony and JBL completely ignored.  As the following reivew will reveal, there are two HD products made by Insignia that I've enjoyed and for which I've written positive reviews. This one is the aberrant \"stinker\" that every manufacturer--even Apple--has, no doubt with good intent, at some point inflicted upon the public.  To Insignia's credit, the HD02 was quickly discontinued by the company.]To the best of my knowledge, no manufacturer is currently making HD radios--not for distribution in the West, certainly.  Insignia may have been the last hold-out, and consequently anyone serious about a new HD radio probably has the best chance of picking one up by looking for left-over Best Buy stock.  Two Insignia products have proven their worth in my experience--either of which is infinitely superior to the pictured radio. The HD01 served me well before I discovered my favorite HD stations on an iPod app (below), and the Insignia Table-Top radio (the simplest, least expensive version, which was listed at 49.95 but is currently unavailable from Amazon) continues to be a convenient companion (it runs on AC or battery, requires no charging, has a telescoping rod antenna, has clear stereospeakers (weak bass), along with handy inputs and outputs. And it travels well--whether in a household or a flight bag).The pictured tuner (HD02) may be a step up from its predecessor--in terms of cosmetics and perhaps durability of contruction--but the touch technology strikes me as a complete disaster.  After working with this tiny screen, tapping and swiping it for a couple of hours, I'm elated to simply toss it in the trash.  I wouldn't wish it on a worst enemy let alone the friend (and radio listener) I had planned to give it to.  Forget the 60 pp. instruction manual, which proved of little, and eventually no help.  There are 3 external buttons--2 for volume (the original Kindle Fire had none), and one for on and off.  Once you've charged this little bugger (which in itself is no mean feat, given the unreadable meter in the upper right-hand corner of the minuscule screen), you're probably best advised to simply experiment with tapping and swiping until you've locked into an HD signal.  I can't fault this tiny gadget on sensitivity or audio quality--both are quite good with a stereo wire with earbuds extended from the audio output.  But when you hear something you like, stop any additional movement--forget about trying other stations or setting pre-sets.  You'll soon be back to where you started from, repeating the \"return to default\" direction again and again.In short, the operation of this gnatty nightmare is sheer punishment to all but the most desperate gadget freak or touch screen geek (or, for that matter, any masochists hard-pressed for pleasure--i.e. pain).  It didn't help that the model I received was apparently a refurb with a weak battery: I was unable to get more than a single hour's use out of the device (touch screen technology is notorious for robbing numerous devices--for example, cameras made by Canon and Panasonic--of power and time--one of the unfortunate copycat side-effects of Apple's singular success with touch screens).But let's end this review on a more sanguine note--perhaps a ray of light for those wishing to tune in a favorite HD station with 24/7 jazz, classical music, or narrated books.  Suddenly, the quickest, easiest, and surest way of picking up most stations in the HD universe is not through an expensive HD tuner or radio (if you can find one) but an \"app\" that you can download to an iPod. In fact, at the advertised price of this discontinued Insignia Touch tuner, a consumer would do well to consider an iPod Touch--even a low-capacity previous edition.  It helps to have a computer with the free iTunes program (downloadable to Macs or, in an altered version, to PC's), though thanks to Apple's Cloud, it's not even necessary to use a computer if your device is less than 2 years old (the same may be true of Amazon, though its Cloud is not as efficient as Apple's).  From iTunes (whether on your computer or an iPad, iPod or iPhone) you can access iTunes Store, click on \"Apps,\" and proceed to download a free App called \"Tunein,\" which instantly locates AM, FM, HD channels--locally or internationally--without the hassles of subscriptions, passwords, social networking.  Moreover, if you have a ROKU box you will notice in the line-up of approximately 12 channels--along with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pandora, etc.--one for \"TuneIn.\"  Give it a spin, especially if your television is connected to a full-frequencied audio system.So there you have it!  Consider my loss your gain.  As for this menace, I'm torn between tossing it in the trash or giving it to a 2nd-hand store for the compulsive \"clutterer\" in search of a bargain and time-killer.  The trick is not to allow this alien specimen to get the upper hand: it's capable of inflicting serious, even lethal, injury.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "The worst argument \"for\" or the best argument \"against\" HD radio?", "unixReviewTime": 1347580800, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2012"}

Ioannides \"Ari\"", "helpful": [59, 60], "reviewText": "I have a pair of Martin Logan Sequel speakers for my main 2 channel listening and have always been impressed with the bass the 8\" drivers deliver. So when I setup my home theater, I got a Grotto sub and was really impressed with the definition and extension of the subwoofer. I've got a smaller system that features a pair of Mission speakers and a low cost receiver with a sub output and was looking for a low cost sub. I found this the Dynamo 300 for less than $250 on Amazon and thought I would give it a try.It was delivered the next day (WOW) and is a bit smaller than the Grotto, but had the familiar look and feel of an American made product from Martin Logan. One problem was the port extension had come lose inside and needed to be reattached. Rather than send it back, I just took the amp out and fixed it myself. Setup was pretty easy with my Onkyo receiver, I set the crossover frequency at 100 and started playing with placement. After a couple of days of break in, playing with the placement and reducing the crossover in my receiver to 90, it started giving me the results I was looking for. It has enough power to fill my small room with very good bass and works well on movies and music. Don't let the 70 Watt rating fool you, this thing tumps.The sound is accurate and tight. The extension is very good, it goes much lower than I expected and without being boomy like so many woofers. Some notes: Setup the system to crossover to take over where your main speakers leave off, as low as you can. My speakers can go down to 50 Hz but don't do a good job at anything below 80 Hz so I set the crossover at 90 Hz. At 100 Hz it was way to boomy. I then used the receiver crossover to remove anything below 90 Hz going to my main speakers and that made a huge improvement. It is VERY HARD to manage multiple speakers reproducing bass in the same frequency range. Letting the sub do it's thing without interference will provide much better results. Another benefit to removing the low frequencies from the main speakers is the amplifier in your receiver will not have to burn power on pushing low frequencies that can be reproduced better by the sub. This improves your overall sound. Warning, While the 300 has an adjustable high pass filter, this sub will not provide a crossover that will work for your main speakers. You will need to manage that from your receiver. If you receiver does not feature a crossover, set the high pass filter lower. You can pick the frequency by looking up the frequency response of your main speakers and go just a bit higher than the lowest number usually between 50 - 90 Hz.In summary, I can't imagine a more accurate sub for the money. Much better than anything costing less than $350 from any other manufacturer. If you are in the market for a sub on a budget, stop looking and get this.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It Thumps - hard to beat for the money", "unixReviewTime": 1334188800, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2012"}

Several options for sounds, picture, quality are at your fingertips. Unless you have never had a tv before, programming is very simple.The base is pretty cheap and at first with the packaging i thought the one part to the base was missing.  The box has two long pieces of foam to hold the tv securely, indicating which end is up. Make sure you REMOVE both pieces as parts to the base of the stand are inside the one at the other end, completely out of eyesight unless you pull out the foam.I found the sound a bit tinny after trying out all choices; srs, movie, basic..but also noted with srs (surround sound) it wasn't that bad.  I have Bose external theater speakers so didn't really care much about the sounds.  What I did care about is finding that my Bose system wasn't compatible with the newer models of HDTV so had to get a RCA dual  adapter.  Pay the 12-13 dollars and get a good one or else the speakers will hum like crazy, distorting everything.Using any other device , connecting with a hdmi cable is idiot proof.  End one to tv, end two to the dvd, roku, or any device that has this sort of connection.  Then you just hit source on the tv's remote control and scroll down to your hdmi 1, hdmi2,hdmi3  etc and there is your other sources.

It came in the original box, which did have some minor rips in it, but that didn't impact the inside of the box when we opened it, the protective wrapping was untouched, (no rips in it). My husband put the stand together and he said it was very easy to understand the instructions in the booklet on how to do it, we also received all the needed screws to put it together. Before we took our huge 25\" old TV off the stand in the living room, we took the new LG to our bedroom and hooked it up to our antenna cable in there to see if it was going to work, (we don't have cable or satellite here, just a regular antenna).  We turned it on, went through the setup process, which for us was very simple and the TV did most of it by itself. When it got done scanning, we had channels on it, yes, the sound was low as read in earlier reviews, but also if you read all the reviews, some do tell you how to get that sound level up, which is going into the main, advance setup and adjusting the audio to the higher level, (also where you adjust your screen size, your clock, timer, child lock, etc). Since buying this and using it daily, we have not had any problems with this set at all!! It works great, the picture is very good, the sound once adjusted is good too, you don't have to turn it way up anymore once you make the initial setting in the advance setting area, (but we have noticed some channels do have lower volume then others), that is not the TV's fault though.  One of my biggest questions I had about the TV, (since we don't have anything but an antenna), was if we needed to use our digital box we had to purchase years ago, which was answered if you read all the reviews on, but the answer is no, you do not need the digital box to run this TV, it's made right into the set. It also picks up anything in the scan process that you might have hooked up to the set as well, such as cable and/or satellite, it even has a hook up for the computer, (which we have not used), but we have used the USB port to look at some pictures on the TV that I had downloaded into my flash drive, it read the flash drive as soon as I put it in.  The only thing I can comment on that I don't care much for is the remote control, the buttons are set pretty funny on there or it might just be me, but I'm always hitting the wrong button to try and mute the TV. Other then that, I have not found a thing wrong with it! I also went online to e-bay and found an extra remote for this TV so we both can have our own. I'm am very pleased with this TV we purchased, though some reviews weren't good, but we've had no problem out of ours.

When it comes down to it, they do their job and don't seem to take away from the sensitivity of the touch pad.

I did not notice them before, so I had to slightly lift up the screen protector at that area to remove the two plastic circles. Because of that, I got a few specks of dust around that part and it also seems that the air bubble around those holes will take some work to get rid of. Perhaps in time it'll settle in but for now, I'm satisfied with it. And I still have 2 more screens in case I get bored one day and redo it.

My camera's strap could hold a boat to dock it is so strong and I would not want my camera in any other strap or manufacturers hands. What if the strap broke on the case and my camera fell into water or a lake or whatever. I would much rather trust my strap especially since this case is built to work with your camera's strap that comes with your camera whether you want it or not.The bad:1.

I've wanted to upgrade for a while and have tried various earphones along the way, but none have impressed me. After some online research, I decided to order four pairs of earbuds - the Ultimate Ears UE600 and UE500, Klipsch S4 and the SE215's, with the hope of finding at least one pair that's a keeper. I was looking at the under-$100 price point.The UE500's sounded okay, though the bass was a bit boomy and the highs could be cleaner. They also seem cheaply made and I wouldn't expect them to last. The UE600's are excellent and I may keep them. The balanced armature driver provides amazingly detailed vocals and instrumentals. They don't provide very deep, extended bass, however they do seem to handle lows accurately and are fine for everything but bass-heavy genres like hip hop. After hearing the S4's, I'm surprised that they have such a large following. They sounded very average, with exaggerated, boomy bass and rather harsh (sibilant) highs. Just shows you what one good CNET review and effective marketing can do. For the current price of $59, however, they're worth it if you need some loud earbuds with good sound isolation to use in noisy environments.The last pair I tried were SE215's. To be honest, I wasn't too excited about these, as I expected them to be uncomfortable, with the over-the-ear style and relatively bulky design. But that all changed as soon as I heard them. These are the nicest sounding earbuds I've heard by far. Smooth, balanced, warm, distortion-free sound from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows. And the bass is not only deep, but tight and controlled. I can see the sound of the UE600's or S4's being fatiguing after an hour or so, but the 215's sound so sweet I think I could listen to them all day. While no audiophile, I think I'm pretty picky and I honestly can't come up with any criticism as far as the sound. Shure has been around since the 1920's and has a good reputation, which gives me confidence in the design and engineering that goes into their products. Many of today's trendy brands probably just outsource design and manufacturing overseas and are more about appearance and bling factor, rather than sound quality. I've always had this image of Shure appealing to purists who prefer a totally flat frequency response and who listen mainly to classical music. The SE215 is the first model that has more of a v-shaped curve, with some bass enhancement. The amount of bass is just right - somewhere between flat and extended, as with bass-heavy earbuds. The result is a rich, full sound that is great with all genres of music and which most regular, non-audiophile users will probably prefer.The quality is top notch. There are substantial strain relief moldings at all cord junctions. The cord and plug seem quite rugged and furthermore, the cord is replaceable. The 215's have a 2-year warranty, which is great for earbuds. Six sets of tips are included (3 silicone and 3 foam). I went with the silicone tips, since I'm too lazy to mess with the compressable tips each time.Putting them on is fairly quick and easy once you get used to it (though slightly less convenient than under ear buds). They're also very comfortable, once you know how to position them properly. If you wear glasses, there might be some discomfort after a while due to having both the wire sleeve and the arm of the glasses resting on your ears. There are some photos online of people wearing the SE215's incorrectly (left and right sides reversed). Obviously, using them correctly makes a huge difference in comfort and bass response. The over the ear style helps keep the cord out of the way, where they're less likely to snag on something. The sound isolation is very effective, which means they shouldn't be used anywhere you need to be able to hear. If you're considering these but are hesitating, give them a try.

I don't need an extremely powerful flash, just something to brighten things up in low light, usually around the house.  I shoot an Olympus E-PL2, and the built-in flash is frequently too weak.The Metz 24 is fairly inexpensive for a TTL flash, but it does a nice job of getting a correct exposure.  The head tilts up for bouncing the flash off a ceiling.  It takes four or five seconds to charge the capacitor after turning it on, but it recharges in just a couple seconds between shots.The build quality is good enough, though not stellar.  The tilting head has a bit of play back and forth, and the battery cover fit could be bit tighter.  The shoe mount base is plastic, which is my biggest worry.  But I can't be too hard on the thing, as it feels like it'll hold up pretty well.The flash head makes a really loud clicking sound when tilted up or down.I would have liked the AF assist lamp to work with the E-PL2, but it doesn't.  This probably isn't the fault of the flash, though, but a firmware issue with the camera.The power of the flash cannot be controlled manually from either the flash itself, nor from the camera.  It's TTL only.  You can, however, use flash exposure compensation, which makes up a bit for the lack of manual control.Sometimes, a flash will come with a storage pouch.  No such luck with the Metz 24.  If you want to protect it, it'll fit in some lens pouches, and some inexpensive pocket camera cases.

We didn't want to give up the local stations though, so we started looking around at options.  One of the reviews on this product sold us, so we ordered one and tested it.  When we hooked it up to the living room tv, it picked up 21 digital channels, many of them looking better than they did on cable.  So, we ordered a 2nd one for the bedroom tv.  In the bedroom, it was a little more difficult to pick up a clear signal.  It needed a direct path to the windows.  If we tried to place it where it would be less conspicuous, it does not get a signal.  So, we ended up with a very visible cord leading up to a painting we have above the tv.

With the price occaisionally dipping below five hundred, I'd say it's a real bargain, price/performance wise. You'll notice that with the competitors in this price range there are too many complaints about difficult setup, difficult configuration, software problems, need for constant updating, heating, etc. The RX-V671 has none of those issues. I haven't even bothered to update the firmware and the unit works great, right out of the box!True, it doesnt support Airplay, as is, but CNET made too much of this missing feature - Apple users are not the majority, yet. Otherwise, it should have beat the Denon 1912 in their 2011 ratings, and CNET almost admits this.Clearly, on-screen graphic menuing is the wave of the future and Yahama is the leader. Today's HT setup can be complex and tedious, dealing with all the different standards for audio and video and all the possible tweaks and configurations. Before the Yamaha, I was behind, technically, with an old pro-logic setup receiver and had to spend some time reading and getting up to date on all audio and video standards and features. Even if you are an expert, you still have to apply that knowledge to set up a new HT system and the Yamaha makes that part much easier.The intiutive, on-screen menuing makes configuration and on-the-fly adjustments relatively quick and easy. There's always room for improvement in menuing and I can't say it's perfect, but it's far better than anything currently in this price category. One reviewer wished that adjustments per port and input/output sources were grouped together, adjustable all in one place. I agree, but I'm whining because it takes a bit more menu surfing than it should. Keep in mind, whatever configuration annoyance the RX-V671 has, the competition is far worse! For those who don't want to slog through the manual, I suggest you locate the following buttons on the remote: Onscreen, Option and Display. These three will open the onscreen menus and displays for all the adjustments and configurations. The Info button will tell you the current configuration from the front panel if your TV isn't on.That said, the YPAO does a great job of automatically setting up the speaker adjustments and you really don't have to do much configuring.For easy setup:Set your BD player to bitstream HDMI output. Select \"Straight\" on the remote and make sure your HDMI input ports Decoder Mode are set to \"Auto\" (Onscreen -> Input, select the port and then Up-Arrow to select Auto). Use the \"Display\" button to verify that \"Straight\" is selected.With the HDMI input ports Decoder Mode on \"Auto\" and the \"Straight\" button activated on the remote,  the RX-V671 will automatically configure the speakers according to the input.  The cable TV channels my have varying audio quality and surround but the Yamaha detects the input quality  and configures itself optimally in less than a second.  I keep this as my default setting because I like pure sound, the way the producer intended it.  But it is still easy to cycle through the \"Music\" or \"Movie\" settings on the remote for special effects or to synthesize 2 channel into 5.1.You can monitor the input quality and speaker configuration with the \"Onscreen\" button, then select \"Information\" and the port. The screen will show a detailed list of the input info and a graphic of the resulting speaker configuration.Once you are settled watching video, you'll probably like to try repeat pressing these buttons: Movie, Music, Sur. Decode, Straight and Pure Direct to see what you like of the various sound settings. That's it!I've had the unit about 10 weeks and and have explored over half the features and probably will stop there, that's all I need, and it's probably all most HT users will care about using.Samsung PN51D700Yamaha RX-V671Samsung BD-5500 (free with TV purchase)Cisco Explorer 4642HDC cable boxMagnavox DVR VCRZV457MG9old CD turntable and old cassette deckMartin Logan Motion 12 Front towersInfinity Primus PC350 center channelPolk Audio PSW 111 powered subwooferPolk Audio RTI A1 speaker pair rear surround", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best in its class - Zero problems", "unixReviewTime": 1333670400, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2012"}

Hybrid for iPad 2 Black (602956007722)from Amazon.com for my brand new iPad 2 and received it in the mail today. I was honestly very excited when it came in because I spent the last week almost trying to pick the right case, and this was it.What I loved about it:- Very hard outer casing, and soft insides.- Slim. No bulk.- Looks great. Like something a C.E.O would have.- Good pricing compared to other cases at brick and mortar stores.- Exactly what I needed and reviews were good.What I disliked about it:- Unfortunately, the camera hole on the back was completely misplaced; the hole was more than halfway to the right of the camera. At first I thought maybe the iPad wasn't installed correctly, but all corners of the iPad is clipped on correctly (it's straight forward) and closes like it should. In comparison with the back of my iPad to the picture on the box (which was one of its main features) the hole is definitely somewhere else by like four millimeters or so. I posted a photo on the images section of this product for reference.- Removing the iPad was harder than I thought and requires a lot of force to pull out, and this is without any screen protectors on the front and back of the iPad. I'm the kind of person that would sometimes take the iPad in and out of the case frequently for whatever reason.As much as I want to love this case, I am going to have to return it and look elsewhere for another case. My second choice would be the Case Crown version of the case. I gave two stars because I loved the construction and looks because it's one of a kind, but it's either Marware needs to double up on quality control or I'm just having a really bad day today.Fortunately, this doesn't happen consistently.

Wortham", "helpful": [6, 6], "reviewText": "Excellent Out Of Box Experience (OOBE).The stand was very easy to install and the box included a cheapy phillips screwdriver! Thank you Vizio for recognizing and addressing a very annoying issue. Little things like that make for a very happy customer.Batteries for the remote, two AA, were included also.The TV will need to be laid face down on a clear clean spot. Take a minute to make sure there is nothing, like the included screwdriver, in the way that might scratch your new screen. Last year, I scratched my new computer monitor like that on a power supply that was covered by a thin blanket on the bed.Setup was easy as pie. Just plug in the coaxial cable and set the channel input. We don't have an HDMI cable yet.Picture quality is excellent.On screen menus are intuitive for the most part. Lots of adjustments can be made - you can tweak broad parameters or nitty gritty.Here is a tip for you if you have DishTV. The picture was too big for the screen. I looked at a lot of settings but couldn't find the one that was causing this problem. Finally, with a lot of Googling, it turned out to be the *Format button on the Dish remote. Set the HD to 'Normal' and SD to 'Normal'. The TV remote is set to 'Wide'. That gives me a letter box picture that fills the screen correctly. We don't have an HDMI cable yet but I will update this review once we get one and switch over.Another bit of information that I gleaned - traditional coaxial cables are only capable of 480i resolution. You need at least RGB for higher resolution and HDMI is, of course, optimum. HDMI cables have version numbers. Unless you research it for your specific TV you'll want the highest version number you can afford. So watch out for clearance bin cables. It does make a difference. There are two broad categories of HDMI cables. High Speed and Standard. Standard HDMI data are rated at 76 MHz which is 1080i. High Speed HDMI are rated at 340 MHz which is full 1080p. Standard HDMI cables are fine for TV classes below 32 inch. Those TVs do not benefit from the higher bandwidth of the more expensive High Speed version.There are some conclusions to draw from the HDMI information I found. You can buy the less expensive Standard cable and rest easy in your purchase. Or you can buy the more expensive High Speed and future proof your purchase. The evolution of cable standards, reflected in cable version numbers, means that getting the High Speed now may be self-defeating since better cable specifications in a year or two will kill any advantage to buying the more expensive one now if you get no immediate benefit from it. The current highest version number is 1.3 as of July 7th 2012. Version 1.4 is on the horizon.This is a 6 foot one:BlueRigger High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet 6.6 Feet (2m) - Supports 3D and Audio Return [Latest Version]... in particular, even if you go with the shorter version, read the review by A. Dent about this cable. From what I've read, TVs 32 inch and up will benefit from the High Speed version....and this is a 3 foot one:BlueRigger High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet (3 Feet) - Supports 3D and Audio Return [Latest Version]Back to the TV itself:Really an excellent value for the dollar. If you aren't familiar with the Vizio brand, they are the largest LCD manufacturer in the world. They make LCD screens for other TV companies and computer companies.[UPDATE October 15th 2012]Wow! What a difference a cable can make! I recently got -AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters) - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard] - to use with the satellite box and this TV. The difference in picture quality is truly amazing. So, this 720p 32\" HDTV does benefit from an upgrade of the coaxial to HDMI. I have the HDMI version 1.4 which is the latest standard but I think any HDMI version with 720p or greater capability will give you the best picture you can have on the TV. Shop around.

{"reviewerID": "A1J5HIF41ENSMZ", "asin": "B004T9RR6I", "reviewerName": "Adam Wood", "helpful": [61, 70], "reviewText": "To set the stage for my review, all of my wireless access points are 802.11n (I've been upgrading over the years) with some being dual-band, and my wireless router for the past two or so years has been a Qwest Actiontec Q1000.  The Actiontec broadcasts all 802.11 protocols like this Linksys, but the two differences are that it works over a single 2.4GHz band and does not allow a USB device to be attached and accessed over the network.  I wanted to see if the second band at 5GHz would increase my throughput.  I use wireless for both internet access (on a ~25 Mbps network speed) and streaming HD video to my PS3 (which is wired to an 802.11n access point).Overall, I think that this is a good router with good performance.  I can't compare this against any of the other routers available today, but the following might help you make your decision.SETUPInitial, basic setup was incredibly easy.  Just follow the instructions in the box (load the included CD, plug in the router, run the software) and things should work smoothly.  Advanced setup (such as not broadcasting your network SSID, running two different networks from the two bands, running 802.11n only) was a bit more time consuming for me because there were no included instructions on how to do it.  There is a good manual available in PDF form on the manufacturer's website (it just took me a while to find it) that includes recommendations on improving performance and talks about how to set things up.  I wish that they would have at least included the link to it in the box (maybe they did, but I didn't see it).  As an aside, the browser-based setup on the Actiontec is a lot more graphically refined and a bit easier to use, IMO, than the browser-based setup on the Linksys.SPEEDWith my Actiontec, I was achieving wireless speeds around 70 Mbps.  After hooking up the Linksys and going through the setup, my speeds were also around 70 Mbps.  So, whatever is limiting my Actiontec is also limiting the Linksys.  I had hoped that the newer design, better antennas, or dual-band would have boosted it.  However, it is no worse and is still plenty fast for my needs.  The online manual recommends splitting the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands into two networks for increased performance, which I did.  I still have yet to see if that provides me with overall better performance (as I'm surfing the web on my laptop over 2.4GHz while streaming video to my PS3 over 5GHz).NETWORK DRIVEI connected a USB drive to the Linksys and am able to access it from my PC and from my Mac.  This is my first network drive, so it took me a while to figure out how to map it to both - but once I did, it worked smoothly.  Unlike another reviewer, I could see the entire contents of the drive from both computers.  I had messed around with the router settings for sharing the drive before I figured out how to map it, so that might have done something, but I'm pretty sure that I ended up with the original settings when it was all done.  I do wish that my PS3 could see the drive, but if I understand correctly, I would need to step up to the EA4500 for the DNLA support.MAC TIME CAPSULEI tried running the network drive as a Time Capsule drive with my MacBook that is running Lion.  Unfortunately, I received an error like many Lion owners that the drive doesn't support a newly imposed protocol.  Perhaps a firmware update will allow it to work with Lion, but for now, it won't.  Older Mac OS's might work with it, though.  Linksys doesn't advertise that it will work with Lion Time Capsule, so I'm not upset - I had just hoped that it would.APP ENABLEDI might be missing something, but I think that this just refers to the app available for Android and iOS devices to control the router.  I downloaded it to my iPad and checked it out.  It works just fine with this model and allows you to change some settings.Pros:- Dual-band that can be set up as two separate wireless networks (one on the 2.4GHz band and one on the 5GHz band)- Four gigabit ports for wired connections- Sleek hardware design with all antennas being internal (the Actiontec antennas are externally attached)On my wish list:- Updated firmware to make it compatible with Mac OS X Lion in regards to using an attached USB drive as a Time Capsule drive- Inclusion of the user manual on the CD, or inclusion of a link in the box as to where it is located on their website- Mounting holes, or an included base stand, to mount it vertically to free up some desk space- A more refined browser-based setup", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Overall, a nice wireless router", "unixReviewTime": 1335312000, "reviewTime": "04 25, 2012"}

However, using it up close while working at my desktop computer, it is unacceptably loud.  Also, since I watch TV before I fall asleep I play the sound at a low level and I find that I miss a lot of what is said due to the fan noise.  Had other people not mentioned the sound of the fan I would have thought it was broken or the fan was going bad.  Unfortunately it is not the case.On the pro side:- Set up was a breeze, they color code everything and you can truly have no audio experience to be up and running in just a few minutes.- The sound is actually quite good.  When it is loud enough to drown out the fan it is much more powerful and words are a bit more intelligible than my Sony sound bar.Sadly, I have actually only watched TV a couple times in my bedroom, rather than my couple decade long habit of nightly, since installing the sound bar system.  I now read until I fall asleep (a pro and a con since books have me staying up way too late).", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not for a bedroom and/or desktop computer set up", "unixReviewTime": 1327795200, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2012"}

The padded Crumpler strap really helps, and I don't load up with any accessories (no extra lens, no flash, no extra battery, etc.).  The quality, range and lightweight of the kit zoom is really what clinches this for me.  The Fuji is amazing, but I find there are too many shots I miss because of the fixed lens.

It was challenging for decades using  SLR cameras because I had  to gaze down into a viewfinder with one eye. Focusing was difficult.  I've used NikonNikon D100 6MP Digital SLR Camera,Nikon D70S 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera, Fujis, Sonys, Panasonic, and others going back to the 1980's. Because of uncertainty of exposure caused by back lighting, I've made three sets of triple bracketed photos for each item.Recently some photos were needed using the copy stand where the camera  needed to be over 3 feet high above the table of the copy stand. I had reached my limit as I used a ladder to be able to gaze down on the subject. There had to be a better way. MyPanasonic DMC-FZ150K 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom (Black)just does not cut it for back-lit photos, but it has an LCD screen which swivels out and I would not have to climb the ladder. But the FZ150 does not work well with back lighting.Then I saw the reviews here of the D5100.  It had the articulating LCD screen and was a Nikon SLR! But did it have bracketing of exposure?  It does! With such a screen maybe I would not have to use one eye looking down on a ladder. I could not order the D5100 fast enough. While waiting a day for my D5100 to arrive I watched  a videoBlue Crane Digital zBC141 Introduction to the Nikon D5100 : Basic Controlsseveral times to learn about the camera.Now for my experience with the D5100: It is much better than expected!  The spot focusing actually works, even with back lit objects. I never could auto focus before for these photos. The AF-S stock lens is constantly focusing in auto focus mode, so I don't have to press the shutter button half way every time I want to focus. That method did not work well for  macro close up shots with the older Nikons. With the D5100  use spot metering/focusing  option, and move the little box around the screen for the exact spot to focus on. The auto exposure  on aperture priority actually works too. I bracket anyway, but only have to take one set of 3 pictures for each item rather than three.The articulating screen is highly functional, and with the convenient position of the \"live view\" lever it's fast to go into that mode.  The AE+- functions works in live view, so I can adjust the exposure while seeing the results on the LCD screen instantly before the picture is taken.  The included 18-55mm lens does work for close-up work, and I can still use my old beloved Micro Nikor 60mm AF but without auto focus. Same with my Tamron 90mm f2.8 Macro, also without auto focus. The exposure functions work perfectly though. But it's just a matter of time  that I get more an AF-S micro lens such asNikon 85mm f/3.5G AF-S DX ED VR Micro Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Camerasfor this camera.The battery life is so long I'm not using an AC adapter, which is a first for me.In summation, for production macro close up work using  a copy stand:Great swivel LCD screen with Live ViewAuto Exposure Control that works in difficult conditionsAuto Focusing on close up objects that works well in real time using spot focusingBattery life that goes on  and onConvenient buttonsReal time exposure control in LCD screenUltra sharp photosTakes old lenses (no auto-focus)Accurate white balance (after calibrating preset, see pdf manual)Brackets 3 photos quickly, no shutter lagProbably a great point and shoot too, but I prefer to not change all my macro settings for that such as white balance, bracketing, exposure, so I use myPanasonic DMC-FZ150K 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom (Black)with the Leica Lens for that...", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Best Camera for Close Up Photography using Copy Stand", "unixReviewTime": 1346889600, "reviewTime": "09 6, 2012"}

I also do Insanity/P90x type workouts, and previuosly used a watch with a heart rate monitor to track my HR and my calorie burn.  Let me just start this by saying that this watch is not the watch for you if you want to just track calorie burn during indoor workouts.  I'm now going to spend a few minutes discussing the main function of this watch--tracking your run.I used both the shoe pod and the GPS to track my runs.  They work well together, and having the quick-start available for times when the GPS was a little slow to connect was good.  I liked the fact that I only had to tap the face of the watch while I was running to change laps, or check my stats.  I liked the fact that the buttons were big and easy to use while running.  I liked the fact that the numbers were easy to see even when I had sweat in my eyes.  The GPS function worked pretty well, and I liked the ease of use of the Nike website.I didn't like the fact that it simply couldn't function very well as a calorie counter.  It did fine when I was running--calorie burns were about what I expected.  But when I was using it for Insanity, it only worked calorically for some of my workouts.  Also, it tried hard to assign a distance to the workout--whatever workout I was doing--unless I turned off the shoe pod.  That was ok, but interestingly, the distances would vary wildly depending on the day.  Sometimes, a p90x workout was given a distance of 2 miles, when I did it all in my living room--and sometims, it was only given 0.3 miles.  That was odd, and would have been of no big importance, but if you are using the Nike software to track your stats, there was no option to declare one of your workouts purely a weight/calethenics workout and keep the \"nike fuel\" earned but not include distance totals (which were meaningless).  This was a mild frustration, but one that Nike should have forseen.There is no capability to monitor bicycling distances, speed, etc.It worked variably with indoor equiptment--it didn't work at all with my elliptical.  It worked fairly well with a treadmill.Here is the watch killer for me--This watch is supposed to be water resistant, and I put that to the test, to my sadness.  It worked fine for a while in the pool as I was swimming laps, although it never could track my distance that I swam, or even my heart rate when I was wearing an appropriate heart rate monitor that should have worked in the pool.  But ultimately, after one of my swims, the watch just stopped working.  I had only had the watch for 4 months.Also, the interior portion of the band broke, which chafed my wrist.This watch has a lot going for it if you are only planning on using it to track your runs.  For that purpose and that purpose alone, it is a great watch.  But for what I wanted to use it for--swimming, running, p90x/Insanity, bicycling, elliptical running--all around sports--it was a failure, and now I have a broken watch that does not function because I swam laps in it.I hope this helps other sports enthusiasts know what they are getting.  A great marathon training watch--but not the right watch for anything else.***Update:I called Nike, and explained the problems I'm having with the watch.  They quickly replaced the watch, and I'll give it another try.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "A good start, but a bad finish.

With the center column fully extended, my binocular lenses were exactly at eye level (I'm 5ft9in). The pan and tilt worked very smooth for me, as long as I did not over-loosen the tilt tension knob (which would allow the binoculars to free fall). NOTE: There is a bolt that secures the quick release plate to the tilt ball head. I had to really tighten this bolt (it uses an Allen wrench) securely to prevent excessive jittering while moving the binoculars. After that minor maintenance, I had no problem with jittery focus while panning and tilting. However, when I released the binoculars (removed my hands), there was a one second jitter of the focus on the subject (hope I'm explaining that correctly). Once the jitter stopped (one second), the subject (Venus) was once again in perfect focus. For my purposes, that's not a big deal. The extension, retraction, and overall adjustment of the legs worked very smoothly. The quality of the construction feels very solid to me.

Does everything the manufacturer says it does.  I just got Amazon Prime, so delivery was very fast.  I've only had the modem for one day, so more details when I add to this review in about six months.It was very easy to set up.  Three connections and it was all powered up and set to be activated by my service provider - Comcast.  The actual time it took for Comcast to activate the modem was less than five minutes, but it was between the time I first dialed Comcast until the modem activation that was the aggravating part.I called Comcast on my cell phone because my home phone was voip.  After the initial recorded \"Thank you for calling Comcast\", I was asked to enter the telephone number of my service.  Then I was given a menu.  Press \"1\" if you want this, \"2\" if you want that, \"3\" if you want that \"4\" for everything else.  Since modem activation wasn't on the menu list, I pressed \"4\".  I then got another menu.  Press \"1\" for this, \"2\" for that \"3\" for that, and \"4\" for everything else.  Since modem activation wasn't on the list, I pressed \"4\".  Then another recording \"I'll connect you to a customer service representative.  There was the sound of a phone ringing \"I'm going to finally activate my modem and see how it works\", I thought. I got another recording. \"All our customer service representatives are busy.  Approximate wait time is ten minutes\".  I really wanted to activate my modem, so I waited.  Finally someone answered the phone in a very cheerful manner.  \"Hi.  My name is... Who am I speaking with?... how are you today?\"  I told him what I wanted to do.  He said \"I'll connect you to our internet service dept\".  I got another recording telling me that \"All our service representatives are busy.  Approximate wait time is three minutes\".  At this point, I was shaking and I accidentally pressed the disconnect button on my phone.  Ordinarily I would be happy about that, but I REALLY wanted to activate my modem, so I called Comcast back.  I had to endure all the number pressing I was required to do.  Then I finally got someone.  I told her that I had accidentally disconnected the phone and apparently she had all the information already. \"Oh, you wanted to be transferred to our technical dept\".  \"Yes\".  She transferred me.  After waiting a few minutes I finally, finally got to a person that could actually activate my modem.  I gave her the model number, serial number, and mac address.  I was all set and back on the internet in five minutes.One thing that was particularly aggravating was the fact that every single person I talked to at Comcast tried to sell me something like upgrading my cable tv service or getting their telephone service.  I had to listen to their spiel and explain to them I was very happy with what I had and I had no desire to upgrade.  All I wanted to do is activate my modem.I think Comcast should cut back all the ads they put on tv, all the junk mail they send out, and the sales calls they make to their customers.  I've had several calls from them trying to get me to upgrade, so much so that I've blocked their calls.  Even though the calls are blocked, my phone lists who called and when.  Last week, they called twelve times in one afternoon, even after I told them not to!The bottom line is:Amazon - FIVE stars for a quick deliveryMotorola - FIVE stars for a great productComcast--ONE star for crummy customer service, but friendly people and who finally activated my modem.I suggest that if you have to call Comcast, be retired or set aside some time to deal with them.I have a little postscript to this great adventure.  A half hour after I got my modem activated, a car hit a utility pole and knocked out cable service to my area.  I didn't know it was an accident at the time - I thought I had a faulty modem.  I called back Comcast.  I had to endure the same menu items, then had a ten minute wait for a customer service rep.  When someone got on the line, I told him the problem I had with my modem.  He said \"Just a minute...Oh, I'm showing an outage in your area.  Turn on your tv.  Are you getting a picture?\"  No I wasn't.  \"As long as I know it wasn't my modem...\"  \"Can I interest you in upgrading to 60 channels or maybe getting a dvr.  For at least the fifth time, I said \"No.  I'm very happy with what I've got\".Six hours later I got my cable service back.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "excellent modem", "unixReviewTime": 1340409600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2012"}

This and the wapiti straps (not available @ Amazon but Mr Google can solve that problem in 5 seconds) are a perfect combination. This is a solidly built bag and for someone to snatch away they would need to take you with them, it is that good! I traveled with the flap turned toward my body whenever I was in a crowded space or worried for safety and it is perfect. Also, it doesn't scream \"camera bag\". I'm even buying my new one in black to make it even more inconspicuous (although this color is nice too).Also, it is a beautiful bag. The flap has the \"silencer\" mechanism with the velcro and that is a very good thing to have in many places. The strap pad is very comfortable and, at least for me, the bag sits nicely where it is supposed to and it is not a bother to carry for longer periods of time (no, I would not go jogging or doing sports with it, it is not made for that). And there is the added bonus that it does not screams \"camera bag\" from looking at it. Even my wife, when she held it for me a couple of times, remarked how comfortable the bag was (with the D-600 with Nikkor 24-70 f/2.8 attached inside it).Having said that, let me divide this in two parts:First for the mirrorless and small DSLR crowd - it is a good sized bag and I was able to take my Fuji X-Pro 1 with the 35mm attached + 60mm lens + extra batteries on the loose inside side pockets (don't like this aspect of it...). On the front compartment I took a couple of filters a cleaning pen and the rain cover which I have never used. It is sufficiently padded and offers good protection for the camera.Now, for the BIG DSLR owners... I thought I would have to give this bag as a gift when I got my Nikon D600, even though I loved it. But, to my surprise, the D600 fits with the Nikkor 24-70 f/2.8 attached just fine. You won't have space for anything else (I'm buying a Retrospective 20 for that) but for a day shoot with just one lens it is perfect. If you put the camera lying down sideways it fits perfectly, but mostly I used it with the camera \"standing\". The flap closes fine and for those hours when you are just taking it out or putting back in repeatedly, it's great.Obs: when using the Nikon D600 I need to take all padding out. I guess I could put it beneath the camera for extra protection, but I feel it is just good as it is, never thought twice about the amount of protection I got. Also, for the plane rides, the camera was inside my Pelican case and this became my \"messenger bag\", with documents, my Ipad, a pocket sized book, candies, toothbrush and other stuff, so I didn't need to get my overhead bag for nothing.Obs 2: the inside zipper pocket and outside back pocket on this bag are, in my humble opinion, useless for anything other than a map, perhaps one or two filters. I used it for that end, carrying the city maps of were we were, plus tickets, cleaning pen and tissue for the lens and a circular polarizer.To sum it up: again in caps to reinforce it THIS IS A VERY, VERY GOOD QUALITY BAG, you are getting what you are paying for, trust me. I based on it and the other bags I've seen and the other one I'm buying, I would definitely recommend any product from them. I've owned more than 20 camera bags in the recent years and this ranks at the top in terms of quality.OBS: I've recently parted ways with this Retrospective (gave it to my mom for her Sony NEX system) and bought aThink Tank CityWalker 10 Messenger Bag, Blue Slate Nylon, to go with aThink Tank - Sling-O-Matic 10 Sling Camera Bag.

The sleek slim appearance of the new iMacs is a matter of taste. It does mean laptop chips are used to save space (and power), along with a compact, slower hard drive. This is not exactly the latest and greatest technology in all respects. The absence of an optical drive (CD/DVD) in the new 2012 iMacs is highly controversial. Apple is pushing us toward internet connections instead, increasingly wireless, and deeper into the Apple ecosystem of iCloud and App Stores that it controls, and gets 30% from. Question is, how often do YOU need CDs on your Mac? If you do need a drive, Amazon has several that are actually less expensive, faster, and more reliable than Apple's own optical \"SuperDrive.\" So hopefully we save a little money not getting one built-in. Most of them can sit quietly on the iMac's stand discreetly under the screen, stacked with a compact back-up drive if you wish. (Lacking a CD drive could be much more problematical with a laptop.)Less explicable is omitting FireWire, a connector that Apple pushed so hard, and now abandons in favor of Thunderbolt (to which few products currently can connect), and right alongside speedy USB 3.0 (a great improvement on USB 2.0)! There's no longer a pulsing light to let you know a dark screen is only sleeping.The new screen, allegedly 75% less glossy (reflective) than the previous models, is a great selling point, IMO. There IS less glare, while the bezel is as shiny as ever (lovely fingerprints), but maybe you don't have to grab the iMac so hard to adjust its angle, for the machine is much lighter than before. The screen is a bit shorter as well as wider than the old 20\" model. Because it stands a little lower, it should be easier on your neck if you wear bifocals.I am now using a trackpad and gestures, another direction Apple is pushing us (a la iPhone and iPad). I hated the one on an old iBook, but the sensitivity now is much better controlled to eliminate close passes in favor of an actual touch--all sorts of touches in fact. (No idle drumming of fingertips!) I find it odd that in order to get a \"right click\" I need to also hold down the Shift key, just like in the old one-button mouse days! I think trackpad use may be tiring: it takes a harder push than on a mouse to produce a \"click,\" and there's no place to rest hand or wrist without activating something unexpected, eh? The trackpad and keyboard both slant up rather than downwards, and have no tilt adjustment. I thought ergonomists showed the healthy trick was to keep your wrist straighter, by keeping your hand level, or even sloping downwards away from you.Customer service: I spent a very pleasant 1.5 hours online with two Apple technicians getting OS X Mail to work. For the first time in years I can open Apple's OS X Mail (rather than continue with a different email client). These folks are amazingly good! This experience is also a warning about using Migration Assistant: it can bring forward arcane bad settings from your earlier computer. It can also \"break\" some of your non-Apple software (e.g., Microsoft, Adobe, Epson), requiring you to re-enter product codes, or even insert an original program disk!!! (You do still have them, right?) Apparently not a problem if you bought them recently from Apple's own App Store. The Apple website has vital information on what to do on your old machine before using Migration Assistant.Otherwise, setup is fast and amazingly easy. Apple does it right.

On this  Intel board I can ONLY use the green port for my speakers, therefore I'll have to purchase an audio splitter to facilitate my previous set-up.My other gripe is with something I haven't totally checked out as yet but so far the Virtu software for my unlocked i7 2nd gen processor refuses to install, it claims there is no onboard GPU present!! Now I've read where this may be due to me having already installed a  video card, but come on, isn't this software supposed to be able to decipher between video cards and the onboard GPU and choose which to use regardless of which one's port my monitor is plugged into??!!! I can't be bothered right now but one of these days I'm gonna uninstall the video card and try the alternate set-up using the onboard GPU of my processor and gain attempt to install the Virtu software.Oh one other thing, the Integrated Assistant software doesn't install easily (if any at all). After downloading it, I had to unzip it to a folder from which the executable file worked but wasn't really installed in the traditional sense to the computer. I ran it and tried, with some effort, to update the BIOS as it was reportedly out of date...a lot of problems ensued after a \"reportedly\" failed attempt at my BIOS update...my Intel Desktop Utility software (monitors the temperature etc., of the system hardware) stopped working, and my computer crashed so I had to \"system restore\" it.

Limited space in her bedroom (where the TV was to be placed) made me choose something smaller, and for less than $140 shipped I received a solid LED HDTV with a 2 year warranty.  A great buy and a purchase I would make again in a heartbeat.The picture is bright and clear, with several settings in the 'Set-up' menu that allow you to easily customize your viewing with pre-set views like Cinema or Eco, or with manual adjustments to contrast, color, etc.  The channel labeling is a cool feature that allows you to rename channels or inputs so you know exactly what it is, the way you want to remember it.Scanning for channels is also done in set-up and it took approximately 3 minutes with 'antenna' vs 'cable' as an input (rabbit ears attached to the TV) to find 10 local analog channels and 8 local digital ones.  All the major networks in HD came in clear through the digital tuner in this TV.  We will be hooking up cable to this TV, but I wanted to set it up with an over air connection first to check the tuner out, and it works well.The remote doesn't have back lighting so that you can easily see it in the dark, but that's not a big deal and certainly not expected at this low price point.  It gets the job done!This set would be perfect with aPaper Thin Leaf Indoor HDTV Antenna - Made in the USA!orLeaf Plus Amplified Indoor HDTV Antennain your RV, or in an urban area with lots of over the air channels, and aRoku HD Streaming Playerwith Netflix and Hulu Plus subscriptions.  That combo could make cable unnecessary!I love that it has inputs galore! VGA (15-Pin D-Sub)- for PC monitor function, composite, component video, RF input, USB and 3 HDMI ports.  Outputs: SPDIF Out.This HDTV would be a great buy for someone who wants a 24\" monitor for their PC and a TV.  Ideal for a dorm room in this way as it could serve as a media hub for a Roku, game system, PC, DVD player or just as a sharp 1080p capable HDTV.Sound and picture can be set to automatically adjust to what's going on in the room.  This is a cool function and I played with it, leaving the sound on 'auto', but changing the picture back to manual as it seemed to be too dim for my liking when I was testing it.My Mom loves the TV and that her Roku pops up as a channel versus having to switch to a specific channel like '3' to view it.  Amazon Instant Video movies come through crystal clear via the Roku on this set, generally streamed in 720p or 1080i.  She also loves the Sleep Timer function for Late Night viewing.This is a small HDTV with room for expansion via it's many input ports.  Great picture, nice sound with ports to add speakers for an even bigger sound if you choose.The TCL 24\" is also one of the thinnest LED HDTV's I've seen.

The TCL 24\" HDTV is really impressive when compared to theVIZIO E220VA 22 Inch Class Edge Lit Razor LED LCD HDTVI own in its design, inputs and performance.This HDTV is a super choice for anyone who wants a quality TV backed by a 2 year warranty for versatile use, without a big price.

Wilson", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "After getting my tax return in March, I was wanting a decent Android tablet in the $200-$300 price range.  I wanted something with at least a gig of ram and decent hardware.  I found the Flyer on Buy.com refurbished for a can't refuse price of $189, and at the time it seemed like a no brainer.  But if I had to do it again I'd would of waited a couple months, here's why:I really prefered something with Honeycomb or ICS on it, and upon hearing the Flyer had an update to Android 3.2 I was sold.  However I had no idea how bad the honeycomb update was.  More or less Honeycomb breaks the Flyer.  It becomes slow and laggy, animations are choppy, game performance regresses, the GPS is broken, and compatibility is half what it was with gingerbread.  But thats ok the Flyer has plenty capable hardware, and its less than a year old so surely HTC is going to update it to ICS right?  Wrong.  HTC left the tablet broken with no further support because they decided they didn't get enough sales, so they ditched the 3 tablets they made and exited out of the tablet space all together.To make matters worse, now that I'm stuck with my flyer, Samsung made an excellent Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.  My roommate bought one, and it is excellent, and comes with ICS already.  And now their are talks of an Asus google nexus tablet coming out in a sub $300 price range with an Nvidia Tegra 3 Quad core, really makes my decision of the HTC Flyer seem bad.But now I got all the bad stuff out of the way here's the good stuff.  The tablet is fast and responsive on gingerbread, and HTC made a lot of tweaks to Sense to make it more tablet like and less of a gigantic phone.  The screen is vivid and gorgeous, and you'd think it was a Super Amoled the contrast is so nice, but its not its just a regular LCD.  The Battery life under moderate use is excellent and you can easily get a week out of the battery if your a light user.  The hardware is nice enough to run any game smoothly (on gingerbread) so if you want a tablet just to play games this tablet will suite you fine.  It actually has the same SoC as the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play, with an extra 512MB of ram so games are no problem for this tab, also the processor is clocked at an insane 1.5 gigahertz, so while its a single core, its faster than a lot of dual cores.  The Build quality is nothing short of excellent in classic HTC fashion.  It is a bit thicker and heavier than the competition but the overall feel is solid, and its not by any means massive, it still small enough to be portable.  The Back camera takes excellent pictures if your into that sort of thing, and the front camera is, well a front camera, but one thing I never understood is why manufacturers put the camera in the top right corner in portrait orientation on a tablet.  This works fine on a phone, but on a tablet your face will always be off centered.  HTC apparently had the same thoughts I did on a front facing camera, and put it dead center on the top, holding it in landscape orientation.  This makes the Flyer excellent for video chat with google talk, or skype.  The Pen is also a very unique feature, but I don't use it as the pen is still to this day expensive even with the flyer being discontinued.Overall if you want a small portable tab for note taking this tab is for you, but otherwise if you can't find it cheap I'd look elsewhere.  It's ashame because the device is really brilliant and has excellent hardware but it was a poor effort on HTC's part with marketing and giving up on it so quickly.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great hardware, solid build quality, poor support from HTC", "unixReviewTime": 1338595200, "reviewTime": "06 2, 2012"}

While other tablets were going at three-sixty and above, this was available at two-sixty (and has lowered in price since then).As a note:  every review I've read giving this one star had indications the individual received a defective pad (and likely would have changed opinion if they'd exchanged it for a good one).  While defective units are quite annoying and perhaps quality control needs stepped up a bit, it does mean the resulting reviews are based on failed units.  One cannot judge a tablet from a single defective unit.  The comments about a \"hypnotic screen\" are not visible on my unit, and the statement from the same reviews that the battery only lasted an hour or two indicates a problem unit.  My unit lasts, as advertised, 4-5 hours.  If one puts the screen on max bright or regular wifi use, of course that will reduce significantly (wifi does suck down a lot of energy).  Other bad reviews indicate the user didn't know how to use Android (ie, shut down non-used applications) and could benefit from reading online manuals and forums.The gravometric unit works fine, and it accesses all the popular Android markets (including Google and Amazon).  Included software can be somewhat garbage, but there are always alternatives.  Camera and video work well.I find only two flaws with this tablet: 1) There are better viewscreens (this one fairly blurs out in daylight) and 2) It cannot power from the USB port (which means power drains while plugged into your computer rather than charging).  That does mean it won't drain the power of a laptop, but it is inconvenient to have to plug in a separate charger (which is included with the unit).Those two flaws mentioned, the system rocks.  The dual core is fast.  Screen response is very good.  Dual speakers (unfortunately both on one side of the unit, but does provide better volume).  Lots of plugs (USB, HDMI, MSD card slot, ear phones) as well as Bluetooth and wifi.  No availability for Internet access other than wifi (a definite disadvantage, but then, no monthly charges either), but that's not unusual for units of this type.The system is well-built and sturdy.  I've dropped it twice (once on concrete) without serious damage (thankfully) so it can handle some punishment (not that I'd recommend banging it around).  It is small enough and designed well so that it fits in a suit jacket pocket (be careful when bending forward, that's how I dropped it) or purse.  Overall I find this unit to be well-made.  The screen is all but useless in daylight, but one has to realize it doesn't cost five hundred bucks.  Since buying it I've received two major Android updates from the company free of charge.  I have no real complaints with this unit, especially for the price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent tablet for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1344556800, "reviewTime": "08 10, 2012"}

Good for audiobooks and other general purposes.  It is also sold under the Coby brand at 2x to 4x the price of the Irulu version.  Despite comments of other reviewers, it DOES play standard WMA files (e.g., made by ripping CDs with Windows Mediaplayer).  I have not tried protected-WMA files.FOR AUDIOBOOKS:> Folders play in the order loaded.  Tracks (within folders) play in alpha-numeric order.  So, if your audiobook  is in multiple folders (as it will be if ripped from CDs using Mediaplayer), then load the folders, one-at-a-time in the order you want them to play.  The tracks within each folder will play in the proper order.> If you stop play, turn off the player and restart, the player restarts where you left off--perfect for audiobooks (oddly this feature is NOT available on most other MP3 players).> Plays MP3 and WMA files.  Also plays many other file types such as WMV, ASF, WAV, etc.> The included earbuds are adequate for listening to audiobooks.FOR MUSIC ALBUMS> Folders play in the order loaded.  So, load your albums (folders) in the order you want them to play.  Tracks (within folders) play in alpha-numeric order.  If you want individual tracks to play in a different order, then add alphanumeric prefixes, such as \"aa\", \"bb\" or \"01\" \"02\" to the names of each track.

Repeat is available via the menu if you want it.CONS> Neither the USB plug cover nor the battery cover are attached, and therefore are easy to loose.  To replace the battery, you have to remove both covers.> The \"mode lever\" is too easy to move--probably a problem if you carry the player in your pocket, but not so much if you \"hang\" it from a belt loop etc.> Most functions depend on pressing either quickly or less-quickly, etc. It often takes alot of fiddling to do what you want to do.

They are very \"efficient\" which means that they produce the same volume at a lower power drain.  To test the efficiency of headphones, just plug them in and listen (without adjusting the volume)---the loudest will be the most efficient.INSTRUCTIONSDespite the complaints of other reviewers that the \"manual\" is poor--in fact it is better written and more complete than most inexpensive Chinese electronics.  Oddly the instruction \"manuals\" vary between the colors.  If the three players I purchased (red, blue, black), the black one came with the most complete instructions.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does the Job", "unixReviewTime": 1347753600, "reviewTime": "09 16, 2012"}

If you don't align properly I could see it coming unclasped, but it takes very little to get in correctly and snaps satisfyingly when correct.The floating portion of the strap was not as bulky as it looks online and while not a fashion statement, also doesn't look ridiculous on my thick wrist or my daughter's slender one.

It's not that it has a problem distinguishing between gestures, but it seems to lack any sort of sensitivity. No, I do not mean mouse movement speed, I mean the accuracy of it detecting fingers present on the pad. I have a 5 year old laptop that you could glide your fingers across and the mouse would move accordingly. This one only seems to pick up fingers gliding near the center of the track pad, leave the center and it actually requires some pressure for it to pick up your fingers. Considering that the track pad is central to a laptop, this is incredibly disappointing.The only gesture I really have a problem with is scrolling up and down. There is major lag between the time you scroll with your fingers and the time it takes the page to scroll. You will either scroll too far or not far enough because of this insane delay.-The Screen: I understand that Samsung decided on a matte screen for anti glare, but on a laptop that is designed around aesthetics, it's hideous. There is a distinct lack of clarity which becomes increasingly noticeable on lower brightness settings. I thought ClearType was disabled when I bought it, but it turns out that is just how to the screen works. Want to simulate it on a glossy screen? Go turn ClearType off and look at the jagged artifacting around the text on the desktop icons and various windows. That is what a matte screen looks like all of the time.Now for the positives:-Battery Life - The laptop has three power modes you can choose with the fn keys. Power saver, balanced, and max performance. On power saver, I get an average of 5-6 hours of battery life with wifi enabled.-The Keyboard - It has very quiet and sensitive keys. I find it very enjoyable to type on.-The Duralumin Body - Other than the fact it looks awesome and is very light, everything about the body styling is perfect. The screen closes and opens smoothly, the edges are nicely tapered, and it feels much more solid than the mac book air without being much heavier.-Runs Cool - it won't warm your lap. After watching a 2 hour movie with the fan partially obstructed by my blanket, the bottom of the laptop is barely warm.-Very quiet - because of how seldom the fan comes on, and because of the solid state drive, the laptop is virtually silent under all conditions.-The Wi-Fi- I haven't had any issues with Wi-Fi connectivity. Supposedly it has been resolved with the latest drivers.Bottom Line: Get a portable bluetooth mouse, if you can stand one, and the laptop is easily the best ultrabook out there.It gets 3 stars, because to me, the trackpad is the center piece of the laptop, I hate carrying around extra stuff, and needing a mouse for a laptop is absolutely ridiculous.

The hinge feels very sturdy and I don't have that feeling that the hinge is going to give out anytime soon.  The keyboard looks like a full QWERTY keyboard with a few buttons specifically designed for tablet use.  The iPad feels well protected.  The style looks and feels like a netbook.The Bad:The keyboard is too small.  The design is cramped and poorly designed.  The RETURN, TAB, CAP LOCK and DELETE keys are way to big for this design.  They take up space for the entire keyboards layout making the keys too close together and if you have med to large hands, you will feel it. to turn on/off the keyboard, you will need to hold down the power button for about 5 seconds.  Doesn't seem like a long time, but when you are in a hurry, it feels like 5 minutes.  Maybe it's a setting on my iPad, but the ipad doesn't \"sleep\" when I close the lid.The Ugly:When closing the lid, a magnet keeps the lid closed.  Along the top of the case is 3 metal-like strips.  The middle strip with the CRUX logo is the longest and on each side of it is two smaller strips.  These smaller strips started to come off.  The clue that held them on, is starting to fail.  I put some crazy clue on them to hold the in place permenately.  The casing has a coating on it that is starting to rub off.  Maybe due to my sweaty palms holding it, but nonetheless, it's noticeable.  I've managed to drop my iPad twice so far (once off my lap onto carpet, and again from hip level onto wood flooring).  The casing separated a little, but it slipped back on snugly, however, I noticed a crack near the hinge.  I may put some crazy clue on that to stop it from spreading.Bottom Line:Does as advertised.  a little pricey for something that isn't perfect.  Not that anything is perfect, but for the price, you'd expect a little better craftmanship and design, specifically with the keyboard.*UPDATE*The nice people at CRUX were nice enough to replace my case with a new and improved design.  Most of the issues I've had have been remediated.  The keyboard is still a little cramped, but they must have listened when it came to the quality because this case is much better in that regards.  The coating is either gone or improved and the state of the case stays consistent. The material is much stronger and does not crack upon impact.  The power button turns on/off very fast now.  The only hiccups I have with it now is the fact that the magnets are gone and now you have to squeeze the hinge after you close it to get it to seal.  This is a minor setback as I do it now without thinking about it.  I'm looking forward to the next case the Crux SKUNK.

Nice feature but only works in certain locations. They added a new female voice, but only the original one speaks street names, therefore the 4 star rating.

{"reviewerID": "AN81JUYW2SL24", "asin": "B0057OW94E", "reviewerName": "Gearhead Mania", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "Mad Catz Wireless Force Feedbacking Racing Wheel, Xbox 360The Mad Catz wheel set is designed for the Xbox 360 and is advertised to be directly compatible with modern racing games like Forza 4. I evaluated this wheel set with Forza 4, but I have also owned the Logitech G25, Logitech G27 (both designed for the PC and PS3), and Logitech Driving Force GT (designed for PC/PS3). My favorite is the Logitech G27, although the Driving Force GT is a far simpler (keep it simple) approach that does the job just fine - mainly because there isn't a single racing sim that accurately models a clutch either by design or programming issues.There aren't many good steering wheel sets available for the Xbox 360. The PC and PS3 have several decent wheel sets to choose from. Several people have recommended the Fanatec, but I have not used it in person. Everyone raved about the G25/G27 when it first came out, so I am hesitant to shell out big bucks for another wheel set that is just going to sit in my closet.First off is the installation and mounting. The wheel itself has several rubber base nubs that provide a friction grip to a table surface, or you can opt to use the screw-on lap pads (which I do not recommend for a good racing experience). If mounted incorrectly, the wheel will slip around. The locking mechanism is a cruder version of that used on the G25 and G27. There's one gigantic threaded knob that clamps the desk but this is a very big clamp and interferes with my gaming desk slide-out keyboard tray. The clamp also has to get well under the table, so many coffee tables won't suffice either. If you don't clamp it as deep, the wheel will slip because the biggest rubber pad is no longer gripping the table.You can opt to use the sequential shifter knob on either side of the wheel, to simulate left-hand or right-hand driving. There's nothing special about this knob other than that the knob itself is wrapped in a metal shell. It is not tactile, so you don't feel/hear a click to indicate successful up or downshifting. The paddle shifters are not tactile either, you don't hear or feel a click like on the G27.The steering wheel uses straight cut gears, so it sounds like the Logitech G25 and Driving Force GT, it whirrs and whirrs like a cheap toy, but it does the job. The Logitech G27 solved this by using helical cut gears for a silent approach. The steering wheel also has VERY limited steering lock. I count about 270 degrees lock to lock, and this is far too small to negotiate many hairpin turns in FOrza 4. As a matter of fact, I had difficulty in turn 1 at Laguna Seca driving a Ford GT. I had it at maximum lock and felt that I could have turned the in-game wheel even more had I used the controller. I am used to the Logitech G27's far more flexible steering lock adjustment (up to 900 degrees if I recall correctly). The steering wheel itself is a very small diameter wheel, and I'm not as used to it since the steering wheels in most cars are several inches larger in diameter, but the G27 and Driving Force GT are about the same size as the Mad Catz.The pedals on the Mad Catz are abysmal to be truthful. The foot rest and assembly is feather light so it tends to flop around. It relies on your heels to hold it in place, unlike the G25/G27/DFGT pedals that have a heavy base with spines that stick into your carpet or rubber pads for smooth floor surfaces. The actual pedals on the Mad Catz are cheap plastic with rubber pads, and there is zero resistance for the brake and throttle pedals. They feel exactly the same and I kept locking up my brakes in Forza 4 because it was way too easy to bottom out the brake pedal. The G25/G27 pedals have different resistances to simulate the feel you get in a real car.In addition, the Mad Catz pedals are spaced very very far apart like it was designed for an old person car like a Crown Victoria or Buick. This is a very far cry from the closely spaced pedals on the G25/G27 and real cars like the Mustang, Nissan 370, and Audi S5. Since they are spaced so far apart, I find myself using both feet to drive, Formula 1-style, but the lack of resistance/force on the brake pedal makes it hard to modulate the brakes properly.Setting up the wheel assembly with Xbox wasn't too bad, finding the CONNECT button on my Xbox 360 Slim took longer than I'd expected mainly because I rarely had to use it in the past. With the G25/G27/Driving Force GT, installation on the PC was a bit more involved followed by countless hours of adjusting and tweaking the settings in Windows as well as the game itself.The overall construction and quality of the Mad Catz wheel is very good. The buttons are well designed and simulate a hybrid Xbox controller with a wheel and paddles. The metal parts feel very refined, but do little to add to realism. Turning on the wheel always freaks me out because I hold the Xbox Guide button and the wheel spins a little.Playing Forza 4, I found that the force feedback was a bit strong by default. I was fighting the wheel a lot of times, but it was MUCH easier to control my drifts and to recover from a spin. However, the lack of feel from the brake pedal really diminished the visceral driving experience. I was much better in Forza 4 using the controller versus this wheel set. I wish the wheel set had more steering lock, closely spaced pedals with a harder to push brake pedal, and tactile paddle shifters. I went back to the controller after giving the Mad Catz a good try in Forza 4.Overall: 3/5, great for beginners and intermediate racing sim players. Lots of room for improvement in the steering lock, pedal spacing, and needs more brake pedal resistance. It was hard to establish an immersive gaming experience in Forza 4 as I was struggling to get acclimated to the wheel and pedals. I like the G27 and Driving Force GT much more.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Needs to be improved in several areas for better gaming experience", "unixReviewTime": 1327795200, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2012"}

I quickly installed it, easy to set up, drivers took about 20 minutes to install everything. When I connected my Logitech Z5500, it didn't have a option for DTS or Dolby Digital, like my old Foxconn Motherboard, Which was one of my main reasons for getting this motherbaord. I contacted Asus about this since RealtekACL892 supports DTS and DD. I never got a reply. I thought I needed to get the Xi-Fi software, since some companies require you to get the license separately, but that didn't work. Also, unlike my old motherboard, I only had Digital under Realtek HD Audio Manger, on my old motherboard, I had Digital and speakers, even if nothing wasn't connected to speakers. I tired using analog instead of my coax, and When i did the surround sound test, it thought my rear speakers were the front speakers, and I didn't hear sound from the others at all. Another thing about sound is when I plugged in a audio cable, it didn't say audio cable plugged in, which its supposed too. I assumed something was wrong but didn't want to rule it out yet, thinking its software, even though I'm using the drivers that came with the motherboard. I also couldn't configure my speaker setup using coax, no matter what it says 2.1 speaker when mine is 5.1. Today, I woke up, turned on my computer and sound didn't work. I re-installed drivers, everything, spent all day on Google, but its the sound-card, as others have the same problem with ASrock.Right now I'm using a really old creative Sound Blaster Live-24Bit, from a old Dell computer until i can replace this motherboard.The motherboard itself is a great motherboard when it comes to price, features and ease of use.I currently have:-FX6100-8GB DDR3 1333-460GTX-600Watt PSU-1.5TB Harddrive-640Gb harddriveSo while I'm happy with almost everything, audio is a big part for me, I looked for good, budget motherboards, with Coax out, and found this.Personally I would recommend this greatly if you dont use onboard audio, but I cant afford a good dedicated sound card for a while, so i was really sad when the onboard audio had so many problems.I feel like might just be defective, so I'm going to replace it with the same one, and see how well that goes, if the same thing happens again, I'm going to get a different company.But until I get a working motherboard, that works fine, im keeping the rating low, as Audio really is a big deal for me, as I game and listen to music, and watch movies.Update-New motherboard has been good for 2 months now, but i still decided to buy a sound card as i want dts.\\Update-9/29/2013.

From the lows to the highs everything is well represented in the EPH-100.Talking about the low end its amazing how much bass this 6mm driver puts out, it has really good depth and texture with awesome punch and rumble for such a small driver.  Its not to much bass but more than say my TF10's and FXT90 and it doesn't bleed into the midrange like on some lower end IEM's.The mids are smooth and sit just right in the frequency range as there not recessed or to forward like say Shures are.  It has good texture and detail with a nice warm feeling exactly what you want from a good dynamic driver.  Vocals sound great and it brings out all the midrange melodies and sounds in my electronic music beautifully.  So far I only have a few hours on them (like 10) so I think the mids will get even better after a good 50 hours of play time as will everything else.Highs are, I hate to say this twice but very smooth also and never get harsh or to bright.  They're there and have great detail but its just more mellow than my most of my other IEM's like the TF10, FXT90 and Ety HF5 though its still well defined.  As I listening to them at the moment certain tracks bring them out more so than others but after they burn in it might get a little brighter but if they don't its still very good.The soundstage is about average with decent width and depth but the instrument separation is superb and you can hear every little detail of a track.  Where they really standout in the soundstage area is with their 3D presentation its got great side to side and makes my EDM sound amazing.  It has a nice relaxing presentation and never gets harsh or in your face perfect for late night listening before you go to sleep.If your looking for a smooth, neutral, detailed IEM with fantastic bass under $200 you really can't go wrong with the EPH-100.  This is a very capable IEM that has good detail for a dynamic driver and is very musical in a smoother way, if I were to rate it on a scale from 1 to 10 I give it a 9 and well worth $150 (but you can get it cheaper if you just search around).Update:After having them for almost 2 week and putting about 60 or 70 hours on them they have really started to open up and sound even better.  The highs have more sparkle to them but still very smooth and with better detail.  Mids still are very smooth and at times a touch forward which I like and the bass has evened out, it still makes me think WOW just how good it is in quality and quantity for a 6mm driver.  The soundstage seems wider and with a bit more depth and the separation and 3D imaging are just great with IEM.I like this IEM as much as my TF10's which have been my favorite pair since I got them.  They have 2 very different sound signatures with the TF10 being brighter with a larger soundstage and the EPH-100 more laid back and intimate but both have good detail with the TF10 having slightly more though not by much.Now I'm not a veteran audiophile but I have been getting into IEM's more and more over the past year while being on a search for the best bang for buck IEM under or around $150, and the EPH-100 being my 7th pair its one of the best I've heard so far.  I just can't find any real flaws with them and since I've had them they have been my go to IEM for everything.

Perhaps this is a premature review, since I haven't rec'd my 32 GB class 6 SDHC micro card yet, nor my Targus stylus or the \"Poetic\" leather folio case I ordered from Amazon. But here goes.Fit and finish are top quality.  There's a ton of functionality with it, the kindle and Nook apps work great, all of my books from my 'dead' keyboarded kindle appeared as \"archived\" and were there to read.  Don't miss the Kindle at all-(never liked the handling and forgotten bookmarks, and inadvertent page turning)  This tablet has been well thought out.Things I love about it....The landscape and portrait backlit buttons for main navigation (\"back\", \"home\", \"menu\") are great, they never occupy precious lcd screen real estate, and they switch on and off depending on orientation.  Similarly, the 3 speakers are cool, and only two are ever heard, so stereo works well in both portrait and landscape positions.  The speakers actually sound amazingly well to me, after having listened to music as well as many UTubes.  Plays UTube videos very well; may take a few seconds to load, but I'm working with G wireless as opposed to the N which is much better no doubt. The fact that it supports N wireless is good also, btw.  The capacitative touch screen is good but not perfect, sometimes not responding, but 98% of time responds well with very light touch. It seems like the 3 nav buttons (also capacitative) sometimes require a firmer touch, as opposed to the LCD panel which is seemingly more sensitive.  Game playing is very nice.  The screen resolution is excellent imho.  Angry Birds, a free download from Android Market plays really well, although sound cut off a few times without notice or reason.  If you really wanted the sound back, one had to reboot the device and there it was again.  The other game I've installed in the first few days of ownership is a neat tennis game called \"Cross Court Tennis\". Unbelievable what they can do with tech now.  Variable power strokes, topspin, flat shots, lobs, slices....what more could you want for a measly 2 bucks - and the action is fast and realistic with a choice of two 3d perspectives.

Not being perfected yet, I wished that I could speak multiple sentences and tell it when I'm finished. As is, after speaking and pausing to reflect upon one's next words, it leaves you, and you have to press a few times to get it back.  But for me, much faster than using keyboard.  I'm new with the Android system, and this Vizio currently uses Android 2.3.2 which is a far cry from the very latest Ice-cream Sandwich OS, but this tablet really works well overall regardless.  Having purchased from Costco in Richmond, VA for $189 plus tax (199.99 ttl) I consider this a real value.Have not tried high def videos or movies, we'll have to see about that. Haven't tried bluetooth either.  Interestingly enough, the nav map loaded, and inside our home was able to find our location on the map.  Was that from the GPS sensor, or the fact that google knows where I live??  Can't tell.  Impressive, nonetheless.Negatives:  So far, the biggest negative for me is the limited life of a charged battery.  With wireless connected, plan on 4-5 hours of constant use.  If used sporadically and in \"airplane\" mode (disconnected from internet) it will eek out more time before exhausted, but not significantly more.  Up to 10 hours advertised is simply not realistic unless it was put in sleep mode for 7 out of the 10 hours while also in airplane mode.  There's a neat page if drilled down to \"settings> about device> battery use\" that shows a bar graph representing each app used and what percentage of battery used for each one, over time. It's cool. Haven't tried video chat, but camera will require  a strong light source if you want the image to look ok.  No rear camera at all, but I don't need that since I'm heavily invested in digital cameras.  Weight is a little much, but under 1.5 lbs like most in this size range.  Again, some of the newer ones I've held are lighter and larger and faster as well.  Just need to come up with 400-500 bucks.  All in all, at this time I'm a big fan, and am enjoying the Vizio VTab1008.update:Feb 3, 2013: Well, Its been a while now, with over 30 books read in the \"white letters on black\" b'ground mode so as not to disturb my wife's slumbers in the middle of the nite, and I am quite happy with this tablet.  Seems like Vizio's not going to come out with the anticipated larger one w/more bells/whistles as it's now putting efforts into all-in-one computers, widescreen t.v.'s, and other electronic devices instead of tablets.  But for $189 at costco wholesale, I'm lovin' it.  Must admit tho, that I had to return it and get a replacement unit, because it failed to reply to input commands after a while.  The procedure was reasonably easy, however, and the replacement has been working well for at least 8 months now.  You know, the processor is only a single one, so the tablet can't perform up to the ability of the best ones out there, but it plays movies from Netflix really well, and makes for a decent game playing platform for most titles but the very most demanding of speed and memory types, so I've had a boatload of fun with it, and can say that there hardly is a day when I haven't used it for at least some reading at night.  The interfaces could be smoother, like looking at internet sites that don't have an android based app for tablet viewing, for example, and navigation around gmail is a clumsy, but it's certainly easy to read your emails anyhow.  As a relatively early adopter of the tablet tech, I'm happy with this, and can wait s long time to make a subsequent purchase for an upgrade, since I just don't feel the need.  the camera function is not good, and it's only one sided, but I use full DSLR camera anyway, and have very low expectations for cameras in phones or other electronic devices, even tho they are improving dramatically and quite quickly.

Can Restream old purchased episodes. Netflix App much cleaner and more superb. Streaming and buffering causes no delays or degradation of picture. AirPlay makes up for a lot of the limited channels (with Mountain Lion the functionality goes up even more). iPad Remote easy to useCons: Limited Channels...needs an open API like Roku to build more channelsRoku2 XSPros: Many Channels available, Cheaper ($10), Free Movie Channels like Crackle, AmazonPrime availability, Vendor neutral. iPad Remote easy to useCons: Missing iTunes integration, Poor quality and buffering (constant downgrading the image quality on NBA League Pass and Netflix). User UI is just bland and could be cleaner. Bugs and issues. Most channels you have to pay extra for. Roku disconnects from my wifi network randomly whereas the AppleTV never does during side by side streaming.

The main difference among other models is 1080p resolution, built-in Ethernet port, and a free Angry Birds game. Like the other Roku models, the 2XS has a growing library of channels that include Netflix, Amazon, Flixter, Crackle, NBC, AOL, and a big selection of user-made private channels.InterfaceAll Roku devices use the same simple interface. Channels are represented in a horizontal grid, and once a channel is selected, further grids of selections are then displayed. This barebones sort of presentation means anyone can understand it, but finding any particular show requires many button presses.ContentNetflix, Amazon Instant Video, and Hulu Plus require a paid subscription, but they have the best selection of TV shows and Movies. These channels cost about $6-$10 a month each, and they have a side benefit of being accessed from your mobile phone, tablet, or computer - not just from the Roku device. The Roku also has a lot of free channels that come from Internet-famous websites like Cnet, Giantbomb, Chow, Crunchyroll and more. (Unfortunately, Youtube is not officially supported as of yet.)Lastly, there are the private channels which are made by the enthusiast community. These channels vary in scope, but the wide range of subject matter can be surprising. There's channels devoted to late night tv, sports, specific sitcoms, firearms, cars, tech, gaming, and more. Best of all, most of the private channels are free. (As of Dec. 2011, there was a Youtube channel available as a private channel, but that was pulled because Google did not sanction it. Roku however, has stated it is working with Google to bring an official Youtube channel to the device.)If you care a lot about sports, the Roku might not meet your needs. There are Football, Baseball, and Basketball channels, but they tend to not to be live broadcasts - most are pre-recorded. Cable and satellite TV is still a better choice in this regard.QualityGoing with the wifi connection on the Roku won't be as consistent as using its Ethernet connection. I often get varying degrees of quality even though the Roku's status says that its wireless connection is \"good.\" And if you use the Roku a lot, you could run the risk of hitting your data limit that your ISP allows. (I typically get to about 200-220 gigs of data in a month, which is about 80-90% towards my own limit.)ConclusionIf you are thinking of replacing cable or satellite TV with this - it maybe a good alternative for you. However, it all depends on what content you want. In my case I opted to keep the most basic cable package so I could still get local channels. (There is a private channel on the Roku that has local channels, but the quality of the broadcasts vary.) The Roku then, provides the rest of my viewing content, and I am happy with it. I still miss the live broadcasts of sports from around the country, and having my favorite shows in consistent 1080p resolution was always great with digital cable tv. But Roku allows me to save a lot of money (cut my bill in half!) and still have most of the shows I care about.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Cable TV cost cut in half, has lots of content, but quality varies", "unixReviewTime": 1325376000, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2012"}

My last computer was a Compaq Presario that I bought in '07, and after a little over four years, its on it last legs.  I bought it with Vista installed on it and was sick and tired of the irritating crashes, screen freezes, time intensive updates, etc.  Additionally, it reached the point a couple of months ago where, I started getting messages saying an application failed, and shortly after that, the screen would flicker, and the entire taskbar along the bottom of the screen would just disappear.  About 15-20 minutes later, it would flicker and reappear.  If I was downloading anything when it flickered, I would lose it and have to start all over while dealing with the screen continously freezing.  So yesterday I went to the Apple store and bought a Macbook Pro and the only thing I have to say after having had it for 24 hours, is what took me so long?  Its a breeze to setup, not to mention it boots up in like 10 seconds and is ready to go.  No more waiting two or three minutes for my computer to boot up, followed by another minute or so for my home screen to populate itself and finally be ready for use.  I really like the Facetime camera and all of the effects you can create in it using iPhoto.  I'm still getting acclimated to Mac OS X Lion but thats not a problem.  To anyone considering making switch, I say go for it...you won't regret it.UPDATE:  3/1/11 Just attempted to create my first DVD using iMovie and I had planned to use iDVD but found that newer model MAcbook Pros are no longer being shipped with iDVD as a part of the iLife suite.

Some were bought when I wanted to carry my entire kit, to this one, bought recently, which can accommodate what I really need - a camera with a general purpose lens, a specialty lens, a flash, and the other bits that one carts around. As well, while traveling, I always take a couple sachets of headache pills, a few band-aids, antiseptic cream etc. You never know.The first thing for me was to reduce its weight. So I removed the heavy metal rigs that seemed to serve no functional purpose, by cutting off the fabric where the rings were sewn to the bag.The second thing was to make the closure easier. Pushing and pulling the snaps was tedious. So I got four disk magnets (size of a nickel) from the local hardware store, some iron-on tear-repair fabric from the fabric store, and fixed the magnets under the flap and matching locations inside the pocket (takes a bit of fiddling, not a big deal). So the cover flap stays put when I flop it over, and for more permanent closing, I do the snaps.The next thing was to add velcro to places where it was missing inside, so I could use other inserts and partitions, not just the one insert provided. You can get iron-on velcro at a fabric store that sticks awfully well. I found my locations, ironed it on and gave it an hour to cool and set.I also added on, on the outside, a small bottle of sanitizing fluid dangling from one of the strap loops.The only other thing that I plan to add is a collapsible mesh bag outside for a bottle of water.With these three modifications, I now have a bag that is not at all flashy, can carry all kinds of stuff - the back pocket is great for an ebook reader like the Kindle or Nook, you can configure the inside to carry a SLR plus lenses etc, or a micro four thirds, lenses and a good microphone for video, the small outside pockets carry the bits and pieces, the magnetic closure makes opening/closing painless, and it looks sufficiently nondescript - but not dilapidated - that nobody gives it a second look. The color is nowhere near as green as in the image, its more of a faded yellowing green, a bag that you might have left out in the sun a bit too long.Plus, not being over-padded, it remains a manageable size and weight.I like it.Added Oct. 2nd: Just discovered that the outside rear pocket can accommodate an iPad (barely) when inserted vertically.

Knight", "helpful": [10, 11], "reviewText": "I haven't had this for long (only two days) and so I have not had adequate time to fully explore it's functionality. However, I did want to submit a preliminary review to address some concerns I had when researching this particular unit. For one, I have played with the voice command feature a lot, and it's fantastic! I've had no problems communicating with the device and it has understood me each and every time. I have turned down the radio and closed (mostly) the windows. But this is hardly anything unexpected. If you're going to have a conversation on the phone or use voice dialing on your cell phone, you'll have to roll up the windows and turn down the radio in those situations as well. But minor background noises have not caused any problems for me.Another feature I think is pretty cool is that you can scroll through the menus by swiping your finger across the screen, like you'd do on your touchscreen cell phone. I had wondered if this was possible, but had trouble confirming online. So, in other words, you can press the up/down arrows to navigate through menus, but you can also swipe your fingers across the screen to move up and down or side to side.Thirdly, some folks have complained about the lack of (or quality of) voices on the unit. This has not been a problem for me. If you go to the Garmin website, you can download - for free - many different voices. Some will say street names and some won't. But I've got about six or seven different voices that speak English and identify streets by name. I've also got another six or seven voices that do not identify streets by name. They have varying accents, but I haven't run into problems yet.I've also seen some complaints regarding the Garmin software for map and software updates. Based on my experience, these software complaints are 100% justified. It took way too long, with too many restarts, to get my map updated and to update my software. The system got hung up repeatedly and I had to restart after letting it stall for approx fifteen minutes. I got it done in under an hour, but it didn't need to take that long. I have an extremely fast internet connection (fastest non-business connection available) and it was the software hang-ups that slowed the process.Volume on this unit is LOUD. Admittedly, I prefer my GPS at a lower volume, so as not to interrupt my audiobooks/music/phone calls. But I've got this unit down to ten percent and can still hear the voice well enough to follow instructions.Looks: this device looks fantastic. Has a glossy black finish and looks upscale, in comparison to my 255WT. Also, the 5in screen is a nice size. This unit is very customizable and I'm glad I went with this higher-level model. The voice commands are probably my favorite feature! Beyond directions, you can adjust settings via voice as well. I'll update my review once I've had more time to use it and better evaluate the traffic alerts, re-routing, etc. Oh, and regarding the missing \"re-calculating\" notice being removed: I was concerned this might bother me, since I liked having that feature. However, the unit recalculates quickly enough (faster than my old unit) that by the time you realize you've passed/missed the original turn, it's already got you going a new route. So it's not been a problem at all thus far.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent improvement over my old 255WT", "unixReviewTime": 1335484800, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2012"}

In a pinch, I decided to buy the newest model without much review, trusting the brand that has guided me so well in the past.  As you might expect from the title of this review, I was extremely disappointed, especially given the price of the unit and the quality of its predecessor.Pros:- Flat panel display allows the unit to be more portable and less prone to falling off the windshield as the older, heavier models did.- USB connection allows relatively easy updating of maps (though this takes several hours to complete)- Allows for \"Economy Route\" driving, where if you input your car's mileage it will figure out which way saves the most gas.Cons:- Takes an unusually long time (> 2 min) to 'find satellites' initially.  This has been the case in a number of locations in and around New York as well as other states I've traveled to.- Touch display is not precise, often resulting in typos when inputting addresses- \"Traffic\" feature, while in theory should be a 'pro', has not worked at all from my experience.  It's either never correct about where traffic is, or it provides an update when I'm already stuck in said traffic.- Map updates take several hours and Canada maps are not available by default.- Design is much less intuitive than previous models - for example, the volume control (which I use often - turning it down when I don't need as much guidance and turning it up when I need to concentrate in an unfamiliar area) takes 3 touches to get to the volume menu on screen.  Why not leave this as a physical dial like the previous models?- Most people have experienced a situation where the GPS takes you on a strange route to your destination.  The previous Garmin models did this on occassion.  However, this model uses unusual and impractical routes much more frequently.  I have tried various options (Economy gas, Shortest route, Fastest time) but have not been able to get the system to provide the most direct path during a majority of uses.I'm sad to see the Garmin brand fall so low but I cannot recommend this product, especially given its price.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "One of the few occassions where the older version was better.", "unixReviewTime": 1349395200, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2012"}

I use this mostly while I'm in my living room because I like showing friends/guests the shows I download and online streaming videos (YouTube, comedy sites, ect).I originally had a wireless keyboard/mouse combo I had picked up a few years ago, but in my living room that just wasn't as comfortable as I thought it was going to be.  I was constantly looking for a good surface to use the wireless mouse on, and usually resorting to having the mouse in an uncomfortable position in order to use it correctly, having to pick the keyboard back up when I want to go to a different site, and just generally feeling like everything was taking up too much personal space.Enter this keyboard.  I love the smaller size, and I got it for the included touchpad.  The two finger scroll takes a little getting used to, but now that I have it down it does not scroll too fast for me to handle.  The keys feel similar to a laptop keyboard, but that's not a bad thing.  It is very responsive, the keys have a good tactile feel, and I have zero problems with the trackpad doing anything I don't want it to.  I cannot report any of the problems other reviewers have had with the trackpad, I love the tap-to-click and I really like the forward thought process that added a left click button in the upper left corner of the keyboard.  It makes clicking and dragging easy enough that even a novice trackpad user can do it.I can't comment on the battery life yet, because the included batteries are going strong after three weeks.  I live alone, so I don't bother to turn off the keyboard when I'm done with it, as no one else will pick it up and cause me any headaches.  This is NOT my main keyboard, when I'm doing heavy typing work I have my laptop connected to a full-sized usb keyboard, so I do expect the batteries to last many months.  The keyboard does go into a low power mode after a bit of time, and I notice it because there is about a half second delay upon first using the trackpad if I've not touched it in over an hour's time.In terms of range, I typically use this at a distance of between 10 and 20 feet, depending on where I'm sitting in my living room.  I see absolutely no problems with range, and I've tested it through a few plaster/load-bearing walls and had no problems with it not receiving the signal.  I usually have the laptop with the receiver sitting on my entertainment center using WiFi, which has a 40\" LCD TV, XBox 360, and stereo equipment, and with everything running I still do not get any interference.Used as basically an advanced remote for my laptop, this is a fantastic solution.  I don't recommend it for full-time duty though, if only because it is NOT a full-sized keyboard and if I had to write a long paper or do full-time work on, it would become uncomfortable over time.  However if you are in need of a good solution to having very little space to work with and don't mind the slightly smaller than normal keyboard, you could do much worse than this keyboard, and for the price there isn't much out there with the same high-quality build of Logitech.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great solution to an uncommon problem", "unixReviewTime": 1334707200, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2012"}

All the older designs I have had (and I have had a few) did not give you a comfortable feeling about the safety of your smart phone.

Very nice screen and good build quality.  By update, it runs ICS (Android ver. 4); I updated the OS right out of the box.  The device runs fast enough for me; I accept that I have to have a few milliseconds of patience.  I'm not running streaming video.  I'm using it to get e-mail, to browse the web, to read Kindle/PDF books, to do some note-taking and to mark up documents.The key benefit/selling point for the device:  It includes a nifty battery-powered stylus.  The stylus has a small tip and is pen-like (not finger-like).I bought this specific tablet because I prefer to use the \"one of these\" that the brilliant Steve Jobs assailed when he spoke of tablet computing -- the pen-stylus.I really like the pen-stylus input.  I don't like using my fingers.  And I don't like the smudged-up screen that results from finger/touch input.  If you are sort of a neat freak in that regard, you will love this tablet.  And I'm just not good at finger-on-touch-screen typing.There are quite a few apps to try out -- I haven't yet found a perfect one for pen-stylus input.  But a few work well-enough for me.I put the tablet in a folio case (the one from MoKo) and it is a nice fit (once you have the full-size SDHC card installed first -- you can't remove the card when the tablet is in that case).  The folio protects the tablet well.  The tablet-folio combination is brief-case friendly; it is very nice to be able to leave the computer behind now and then.I also purchased a short right-angle micro USB cable that I think will protect the USB plug from mechanical stresses that apparently have caused problems for others.  And I try to handle the device with care.The tablet is not light but it is a good weight; and it feels solid and not fragile.  Battery life is nothing notable in either direction.I like the tablet.  I love having a smudge-free screen.My wish would be for a screen that is closer to letter size.

After the initial burn in time of about 200 hours, you'll find the depth of sound you can hear in each song is incredible. I find that even after the initial burn in time, music will still sound better after you've had a few initial songs play through them each time you use them again. The highs are amazing and the clarity is like crystal. Not heavy on the bass by any means, but after some burning it, they definitely do have enough. Voices sound clear and you can literally detect every layer of sound in a song. Rather than everything blending together into one sound, you can actually detect the different volumes of each of the different instruments and voices. The sound is much more like listing to music in person, or on a high quality set of speakers, rather than that of typical earbuds.Their design is unique, so take some time to make sure you have them in the correct ear and also that you adjust the posts that hold the ear tips, as they can move forward and back to best align with your ear. Without realizing the posts adjust, it may look as though the left ear and right ear bud should be in the opposite ears. Also these have an over-the-ear design, so the cables should wrap over your ear, not hang down like most people are use to. There are a ton of tips in all different sizes that come with this set. I find that using the smallest one works best for me, since I have very small ears. Once you have set the posts to the right angle for best fit and also found the correct tip for your ear sizes, you will find these offer stellar sound and amazing noise isolation. I can be in the same room with my two kids playing video games right beside me, while they are yelling and hollering and when I have music on, I can't hear a single thing from them. Nothing at all. I've never had earbuds with such effective noise isolation before, it's amazing.The cable is slim, but thicker than most, which is a good thing since it will be less susceptible to breakage. It feels quality in design and I have no issues with tangling. The earbuds come with two forms of storage, the first being a small round case for the earphones themselves. It zips around and is a about the size of the palm of my hand (small hands). The second form of storage is a small pouch which is for holding all the tips. The whole set arrives in a plastic case with a black velvet setting.I'm completely blown away by the sound from these. Once you take a little time to get these all set perfectly for your ears (the tips, adjusting positioning, etc) and you've let them burn in for a good amount of time, you'll find they play music unlike any others.

Since I only have used Intuos for about three weeks before buying the Capture, there aren't any feature that I miss (except the smaller size, but more on that later). Some reviewers mentioned lack of eraser as a big deal, maybe because I never used it on Intuos, I don't miss it at all. Erasers are only a shortcut key away anyways.

Be aware that not all of the gray surface in the pictures is usable, about 75% of the total area. It is clearly marked by lines on the edges of the working rectangle.Speaking about the size of tablet, the screen size should also be taken into consideration.

I'm sure even with smaller screens, bigger tablets = more precision = better results, but once again, for beginners, Capture's area is big enough.This tablet allows me to make some decent drawings on Illustrator. Using a tablet doesn't enhance your drawing skills, but it is definitely much better than drawing with a mouse. There's a learning curve to it, but it's not impossibly difficult.I read a lot of Wacom users complain about the nib wear on the latest generation of Wacom tablets. I haven't used it long enough to comment on nib wear, but it doesn't seem to be used at all after two weeks of use. Perhaps I just don't use it as much as those hard-core design enthusiasts.I like having the 'paper-like feel' drawing surface, but personally I don't like that feel when I'm using it for InDesign layout purposes. I'd rather have more 'glide' on the surface. So I bought a clear plastic folder, cut a tablet-sized piece and taped it over my Capture. It glides around easier (and perhaps saves the nib from wearing out too quickly). The folder only cost me 50 cents. Also, if I need to have that paper-like feel for precision drawing, I'll just remove the plastic cover and re-tape it afterwards. If you want to do so, use a low-tack tape to prevent tape residue build up on the tablet surface.For me, the biggest advantage of using a tablet is less fatigue on your wrists. When you're clicking and dragging a lot, such as when you're doing page layout in InDesign, using a tablet will be much easier on your wrists, and also much more precise.The multi-touch feature is a nice addition to the tablet; sometimes I use it for browsing. I still need to practice the multi-touch gestures, such as flick and scroll up/down, but so far I found the scroll and zoom feature really helpful when I browse. I didn't buy the tablet to use it as a full time track pad, but for me it is an useful extra feature.Overall, I'd highly recommend this tablet if you're a beginner / early enthusiast of digital graphics design. Or if you're looking for a giant trackpad. If you are a serious enthusiast, perhaps you'd like to consider Bamboo Create (a bigger version of Capture) or Intuos.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding tablet for non-professionals", "unixReviewTime": 1330128000, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2012"}

However, the backup software is fatally flawed and I see other reviewers have had the same experience.I went through the setup process fine, and backed everything up. The only glitch was I was forced to supply a password. I did it, but I checked the box that said my user name could access the drive without the password.I tried to restore a test file, and was told I needed a password. I typed in the short, all lower-case letters one that I had supplied, one I have used many times for no-security passwords. I was told the password was incorrect. After trying it again, and no password, and a few other things, without warning I was told the number of attempts had been exceeded and the drive was permanently locked, with no recovery possible. The user name access obviously didn't work either. Incidentally, I used the same password to set up my Western Digital support account, and it was also refused when I tried to use it. I checked \"forgot password\" (an option not allowed on the drive itself, without a password the data are completely and forever unrecoverable). They sent me a new one by email, I cut and pasted it in, and it didn't work either. I tried a second time, and succeeded. This company is password-impaired. I know you may be thinking that I'm the world's worst typist, but I don't think that's the problem.If you're using the drive to carry files around, or just for spare capacity, this isn't a problem. But if you are counting on the drive backups as insurance for rare events, having even a small possibility of not being able to retrieve your data due to a software glitch on the drive makes it worthless for the purpose. I cringe at the thought of backing up files carefully for years, then finding out the drive is locked when you need to recover them.I had to erase the drive and start over. I searched the manufacturer's knowledge base and some Internet sites and found mine is a common problem. There were two likely causes. First is that I updated the software after backing up the files, but before trying to retrieve one. Apparently software updates sometimes scramble passwords. Second is that I powered down the computer in between backing up and trying to restore. Apparently powering down the computer or removing the USB cable without ejecting the drive can scramble passwords. If either of these are the correct answer, it obviously is impossible to rely on the drive to get back files you have backed up. For one thing, if your hard drives dies (the most common reason to need a backup), it would likely scramble your password.I thought about returning the drive on the theory that a manufacturer this sloppy about software might be sloppy about other things. Clearly Western Digital has no idea of required functionality for a backup drive, absolute reliability over years of use. Passwords should not be allowed, much less be mandatory, and if you have them, they have to be completely reliable.I think I'll keep it, however, and use it with some good quality backup software.

After being disappointed by the step down in quality they took with this generations official cover, I gave the Marware a shot. I am super critical of covers, so I expected this would get 3-4 stars and I would have been content with that. However, Marware really stepped up their game with the Eco-Vue. The name makes it sound cheap, but it's one of the nicest feeling, most solidly built covers I've seen for the Kindle. The K4 sits so nicely in there it just seems like it was made for the cover rather than the other way around. I'm not a big fan of the strap system, but it's done very well here, with the black version of the Kindle looking especially nice inside.It's actually worth the cost, which is not true of almost all the covers of any price. Note: The cover did not fold flat on its own right out of the box, but that is actually a good sign with leather covers, and in time I have no doubt the K4 and Eco-Vue will grow into each other. In the meantime the elastic strap makes up for that. I was a little apprehensive about the internal hand-strap, because I prefer a plain, clean interior, and thought it would be aesthetically displeasing or leave lint or markings on the screen. So far my concerns have been unwarranted.Best thing this has over the official cover is it actually has padding, which you can't tell from the photos. Some covers claim padding but don't quite deliver. If you're looking at it wondering about that, let me assure you it is a pleasure to hold. I never expected this level of quality from Marware, but I gotta say, I have an $80 Italian Kindle cover that is not as nice as this.

Video is usually good, but if you are filming a performance where there is silence at times (say a play), you can hear the zoom motor and a definite click as it stops and locks.  This does not make for good video as any zooming is underlined and attention is taken away from what you are filming.  I rarely do that kind of filming, but this is a disappointing camera in that aspect.  However, to be fair, I don't notice the zoom noise when taping musical performances or when speaking is pretty much non-stop as with a speech, sermon or lecture.  But zoom motor noise is glaringly there when there is silent or very low volume action going on.Also, battery life doesn't do much better than 30 minutes even with freshly charged batteries.  So, if you want to film a longer event, this is not your camera.  Also, if you carry the camera around and expect to pull it out for events you just happen upon, don't expect more than 4-5 minutes of battery life for video footage.After 8 months of use, I would now give the SX150 a three or four star rating.

It doubled the optical zoom, still used AA batteries, and added manual mode and all for only $165.This is a beauty.  I've tested it on people photos, hand held photos of the moon in manual mode, and macro close ups.  It has performed very nicely.  Even the flash has performed well for a little flash. The video footage is well lit and even does reasonably well in a semi-dark room when you zoom in on the subject.The battery indicator is way too sensitive.  At a child's birthday party not long after I had put newly charged batteries in it warned me that the batteries were getting low.  I decided to see how long the batteries would last.  Twenty-one minutes of video and various still shots later the batteries were still going.

I have been using a Canon SLR for the past five years, so a lot of my experience (and basis / comparison for this review) is using the Canon as a benchmark.  I am not a professional photographer, just a husband and a dad that takes a few pictures in our walk of life.The shutter speed is pretty darn fast - a lot faster than my Canon.  Sony has done a good job with the technology that allows rapid-fire clicking and if you aren't careful you will have whipped out 3-4 shots when you only meant to take one.  I had to practice for a bit to get the method down.Switching the lens out for my Canon-branded zoom lens was easy, but I needed an adapter.I took several indoor pictures with medium and bright lighting, and several pictures outdoors of the flowers in my garden, at the same time, as a comparison of the Sony and my trusty Canon.  I then put the pictures side-by-side on Photoshop and the ones outside with the Sony and the same lens were much more crisp, colorful, and printed a lot better than the Canon; the ones taken inside with either lighting situation were just a little bit better in looks for me - I will attribute that to the larger megapixel of the Sony vs. the Canon.This is a fairly well-built camera, and has a smaller profile than I thought it would and really doesn't weight too much.  This is not something you can put in your pocket or a smaller purse but, depending upon the weight of your lens, you're probably not going to have a pinched nerve in your neck after wearing it to a gymnastics meet.I have not used the video that much, maybe about 30 minutes or so, but the resolution and sound is pretty good - I think my standalone Sony video camera does a better job, but when you want to quickly revert from one to the other this model does an acceptable job.The battery understandably drains down quicker on video mode, so if you plan on doing a lot of video with this camera you might want to consider buying a larger-capacity battery or a backup that is charged.  For straight photo shooting, I didn't notice a large degradation in the battery power after several  kid events (50-75 shots per session), and I usually put it back on the charger at the end of the day.  Your results may vary.One neat thing to me is you can look at your shot on the digital screen, but if you put your eye up to the viewfinder it automatically detect s you looking through the viewfinder and switches the view to it and turns off the LED screen which will conserve your battery.  They also have GPS tagging, which could help you when you review your pictures and the inevitable question \"where was that taken\" question comes up.Overall, I think this is a really nice camera and I am using it exclusively now - since I have additional lenses, I am liking this one even more.  If you have extra lenses, I would recommend this one - if you are a casual photographer, seeing this one is fairly pricey I would recommend something more economical as $1,400 is a lot of money to pay for just a few pictures a year.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Camera and Excellent Picture Quality", "unixReviewTime": 1340150400, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2012"}

But, can a modern consumer lens compete with an old legend? Gots to have a test...I have a 40 year-old Leica Elmar-C 90mm, off of the \"entry level\" compact Leica CL of the day. And while it is old, nothing is really all that new in the actual optics, especially in this focal range. Even the coatings were just fine then. It is a heavy little sucker, made of glass and brass, and nearly the same weight as the far bigger Sony.Nothing like the Big Sur coast for photos of rocks and water. Perched on a rock above a cove where the ancients once gathered abalone, I shot away with all of my lenses and my newly arrived Nex-7 from Amazon. Yay! Not a horrible way to spend an almost 75 degree sunny day in early March.After downloading and enlarging the results at 100% it was evident that at 90mm the Sony was just a hair less sharp in the center than the Leica. At the edges, the Leica was clearly superior. Wow! To me that is both a testament both how good Leica was making entry level lenses 40 years ago and how an affordable, automated zoom can compete with a quality prime lens at the length and sunny lighting conditions that the Leica was optimized to work at! Awesome.I believe that even a laboratory sort of test would find the same results. It was pretty clear in a real world sort of way.And, in the real world the Sony goes way beyond what any prime can do. You can zoom in and fill the frame, avoiding cropping. This will equalize the sharpness factor in many cases. It can focus automatically, has optical stabilization so that even the longest telephoto shots are sharp. It can be hand-held and allows for high shutter speeds, an aid to sharpness in itself of course. It is capable of fully being controlled by the camera and in essence becomes one with the camera in a way that is different than the past when you manually operated your camera, then manually operated whatever brand lens was on it.In video mode it tracked a big buzzard as it flew by. It focused well on waves coming at me, with the sun glaring from directly behind them.It worked well with a 49mm polarizing filter.The manual focusing is very smooth and precise, with a decent feel to it. It is a very good looking design, again modern in look as well, but the turned aluminum parts are more likely to be scratched than the rubbery, plasticy lenses on my old Nikon D40. I really need to get a decent little divided case. You can't just throw these new Sony lenses into a pile.In the end, this is a quality, useful and well-priced lens, one I will always have with me when I go shooting around. You can get good results with the old technology, but modern lenses like this, mated to the cameras they were designed to work with, are just another thing altogether. The five-star rating reflects the value and utility of this excellent lens.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A modern lens for modern times", "unixReviewTime": 1330992000, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2012"}

However, almost all of those headphones have very subprime sound quality, to say the least. The standard iPhone headphones are not much better, but they are usually the ones that I reach for when listening to music in other situations. Unfortunately, as a consequence of these choices of headphones I've been inadvertently forced to settle for a rather inferior music-listening experience. So when I came across XePort's headphones, I had felt that my ears had been opened. I've used high-quality headphones in the past, and in terms of sound quality the XePort headphones are definitely on par with many of those.***** The Sound Quality *****The sound quality is definitely one of the biggest selling points of these headphones. They make a crisp, loud and well-formed sound. When listening to classical piano works I can hear each note reverberating clearly and distinctly from the others. The high notes don't have the \"tinny\" sound that I've been accustomed to from many lower-end headphones. The lower notes are rich and warm, but the bass leaves something to be desired.. The high fidelity of sound is particularly noticeable when listening to the older recordings - all the subtle \"noise\" of such recordings comes clearly through.  The overall sound quality is not quite as good as the one of the XePort 5010-8 model, but it is definitely above most low-end headphones.I particularly liked using these headphones with dance/electronic music. They can really push the beat through.***** Noise Canceling *****These headphones don't have the active noise-canceling capabilities, but their passive noise suppression was more than adequate for most of my purposes. This is particularly the case when listening to music somewhat loudly - all the surrounding sounds were completely blocked, and hardly any of the headphones' own sound leaked out.***** Accessories *****In addition to the actual headphones, the packaging includes three sets of silicone single flange tips. The tips ought to fit most ear sizes. They are comfortable and easy to replace.***** Look and Feel *****These headphones look pretty elegant and fashionable. I am not too thrilled with the woven nylon cable, but it too has certain charm and can be a fashion statement in its own right. The white ceramic unibody look is very pretty, and it comes closes to the \"replacement\" look for the Apple's signature in-ear headphones. So if you'd like to stick to that particular visual aesthetic, then thee headphones will be a perfect choice for you. I would have liked to have some playback/volume controls placed on the headphones themselves, but this is not a deciding feature for me. The headphones are very light and they fit smoothly and unobtrusively into your ears. Even after a few hours of listening to the music on them they did not become uncomfortable. Oftentimes I have a slight pain in my ears after wearing some other in-ear headphones, but so far I have not had any such experience with XePort 7010-0.***** Conclusion *****These are really very good headphones and they will make any music lover pretty happy. They are solidly built, have a good sound quality, and an unbeatably low price.

But let me discuss/rate the package in its entirety.CONTENTS, INSTALLATION, DOCUMENTATION WARRANTY (4.5 out of 5)This is what you get out of the box:* Sound Blaster Tactic Omega Wireless Headset (the headphones)* Detachable Microphone* Sound Blaster Recon (module that connects to the PC or gaming console)* Tactic Link wireless card (plugs into the Recon)* Installation CD (for PC only)* Inline volume control (for Xbox only)* Micro USB-to-USB cable (2 of them, will explain why)* Optical cableSetup is clearly illustrated by the Quick Start leaflet. It's as easy as attaching the wireless card to the Recon module and connecting the module to the PC or gaming console. Consoles are also using the optical cable. The Xbox requires that the Inline volume control wire is connected to the wireless controller (I only used it with a PS3 and a PC).The headphones charge from any PC or standard USB charger (not provided) through the provided USB cable. I used successfully both a PC and a third party PS3 charger. If used with a PC/laptop you should be able to use the second USB cable to charge the headphones while using them if needed. Once charged, the headphones will link to the Recon module within seconds of powerup.Half a star is lost for the warranty terms. It only lasts for one year and the shipping costs are the owner's responsibility. Make sure that you save the dated purchase receipt to avoid any surprises.OPERATION AND USER EXPERIENCE (5 stars out of 5)When used with a console, the Recon module and headphones all controls are good enough to provide a superior gamer (and not only) experience. Besides volume controls on both the module and the headphones, there is Mic Gain switch (low/mid/high) to control voice input. When playing games you can select the 'scout mode' especially on FPS which will enhance the sounds made by your opponents. The other option is THX TruStudio Pro mode, perfect for listening to music or movie watching.On a PC the options expand dramatically. You don't need to use the provided software on the PC but if you need total control over your THX setup - surround mode from 2 to 7 speakers, bass, crossover frequency - over how you are heard when you speak into the microphone (we're set to 'alien brute'), the dynamic range control plus a mixer and an equalizer that allows you to pick any of a number of preset profiles or make up your own... you will be using the software.I found the adjustable headphones to be extremely comfortable. Hours of use at a time caused no noticeable discomfort.RATING (5 stars)After trying this set out for a couple of weeks I was turned from a skeptical tester to an enthusiastic proponent.

So I do not view this as a bargain basement item.  Especially since this is a name brand Samsung item versus a generic enclosure.The enclosure is light weight glossy plastic on top and sturdier textured plastic underneath.  Light weight is probably good if you want to carry this around.  On the other hand, I have a tiny laptop without a DVD drive so I don't have to carry around a DVD drive built in to the computer or otherwise.  I expect this thing to never leave my house and only be used for occasional software installs or re-imaging.NEGATIVES:When I first connected the device it did not power up.  I examined the plugs and decided the micro USB connection on the device itself did not look like it was fully inserted even though I firmly pushed in the cable.  I gave the USB plug a very, very hard push (harder than I would have been willing to do on a laptop or camera for example).  It slid further into the connector and the device powered up.Then I push the open button on the CD tray and I get a grinding noise.  I try a few more times and the tray will not open but sounds like the open/close motor is just grinding like something is holding the tray in place.  I get a paper clip and start poking at the emergency release hole next to the release button.  The tray still won't pop open even using the \"manual\" release method.  I decide to try the electronic button again and suddenly the tray pops open.The dual USB power connection method is a good idea but poorly executed here.  The included dual connection cable is too short to reach any pair of USB ports that are not directly over/under.  I only see those on old laptops and desktops.  I deal with numerous laptops at home and work and all have USB ports spread around at least several inches away from each other even if they are on the same side of the computer.  Only because I have lots of random PC cables did I happen to have a USB extension that allowed me to connect this at all.  Be aware that you will likely need a USB extension cable at least 3 to 6 inches long to reach 2 ports on a typical laptop unless you have a pair of directly over/under ports.POSITIVE:I put the unit through it paces by burning a 4 DVD recovery media set from a new laptop and then writing back those discs onto a new SSD.  All discs were created and read without error.I suspect that I probably put more effort into getting it to work out of the box then some other user may be inclined to (hence some of the other negative reviews).  Quality control seems a bit lacking for a Samsung product.  I would happily pay another ten bucks for a more substantial enclosure and a better USB cable in the box.

When I opened the well-done package and caught my first glimpse of this beautifully designed keyboard case, I was stunned.  This can't be right.  It's too good for that kind of money.  The back of it is seamless aluminum and the controls and indicators (on-off, connect, status) are intuitive.Okay, so it's very attractive and looks well-made, but will I have issues pairing it with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 tablet?  Nope. The BT settings function on my Sam 10 (my name for it) scanned and discovered the Logitech BT keyboard almost instantly and provided the four-digit code to enter on the keyboard to complete the pairing.  I entered the code, it completed the pairing.  No muss, no fuss.It looks great, but how does it feel?Feels good like a keyboard should.  The keys are comfortably spaced with lots of special keys at the top like cut, paste, email, internet, microphone, sound functions and screen lock, and a couple I haven't figured out yet because I haven't needed them.  Needless to say, it leaves nothing to be desired in the special keys department.The tactile feel of the keys is just right for me.  Not too sloppy and not too tight.Oh, did I mention the perfectly dimensioned grove at the top of the keys where the tablet fits in to make it a kind of laptop configuration?  No? Well it works fantastic.  My Sam 10 fits in that groove and I type away as if it was a for-real notebook.  (I'm still wondering how they can do this for the low price I got it for, but hesitate to include this because they might want to take it back, and they can't have it.)When done with the keyboard, I reverse the Sam 10 so the screen is facing the keyboard and it fits snugly into the slightly raised, about 5mm, walls of the keyboard housing with cutouts for the Samsung cable connector, and a long one at the other end for accessing the power switch, volume rocker, microSD card slot and earphone jack. The result is a compact and slim package affording the Sam 10 screen max protection and exposing only the durable back side.There are no batteries to worry about with this keyboard.  It comes with a USB cable that connects the keyboard to your notebook, netbook, PC, or whathaveyou to keep it's battery charged between uses.The only downside I can come up with, and it's a humongous stretch, is that the Sam 10 doesn't like to sit in the keyboard grove in portrait configuration.  It tends to fall backward.  But, in landscape configuration it sits like a rock.Do I recommend this keyboard to Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 owners?

PureDigital sound processing delivers clear and crisp sound while the tuned bass pipes add deep and tight bass reproductions providing exceptional audio quality. The modern appearing docking speaker, measuring 17\" wide, 6\" tall 6\" deep, consists of a black plastic backing and black metal mesh front. A power port and auxiliary input are located on the back, and a brushed metallic ring on the front serves as the docking area with a 30-pin connector and includes volume + and - buttons.The iPhone / iPad AppUsing the Philips' iDevice DockStudio app is required to utilize many features and get the most out of the Philips DS8530/37 Fidelio Docking Speaker.  Controlling the Dynamic Bass Boost (DBB) and equalizer settings can only be set through the app while physically connected.  The DockStudio app features also includes playback controls, a multi-function alarm clock with sleeptimer and alarm, music collection browsing, sharing via Facebook and Twitter, access to more than 7,000 internet radio stations and podcasts using TuneIn radio, plus displays current local weather conditions.I'm indifferent to using the DockStudio app.  The alarm clock requires the app to be running for use, browsing and listening to the internet radio stations and podcasts is tedious, and the app doesn't integrate with Pandora accounts.  Plus the weather feature tells me I don't have an internet connection on my iPad, even though I do.  Philips attempts to enrich the Fidelio experience may successfully do so for some, but not for me.  If it weren't for the audio setting capabilities, I would remove the app from my iDevices.The Fidelio DS8530/37Setting up the Fidelio DS8530/37 docking speaker is as simple as plugging it into an electrical socket.  The included Quick Start Guide uses nothing but images to indicate how to use the docking speaker and is most likely unneeded.  Even though the docking speaker should work without removing protective cases, my iPad'sBelkin covermust be removed to attach.  However, docking my iPhone to the Fidelio DS8530/37 doesn't require removing the case.  Once docked the remote provides typical music player options, which also works with Pandora.The Fidelio DS8530/37 docking speaker isn't designed to include Bluetooth connectivity.  However, it's painfully obvious this common feature is missing.  As a result, I must choose between relinquishing all control to the docking speaker and using my device for other purposes.

Plus the lackluster DockStudio app provides expanded usability and is a tool for setting the various sound options.  However, the lack of Bluetooth capability would be reason enough for me to consider purchasing an alternate docking station.

You can also easily fold back the flap which makes it feel like a book when you are reading, and the 'latch' that just fastens the case gives you extra security when you hold it.

According to the web site the current 2.0 version will already work with Mountain Lion.  You must download the software from the web site; it isn't included in the box.  Be sure to get the software serial number inside the box before you throw the box out.What is included:- 3 overlays: NUM10, NUM20, and NUM30- marker to write on the overlays- cleaning cloth- plastic card to apply the overlay- card with the software serial numberThe overlay does not appear to affect trackpad sensitivity at all.  It is smooth, so sliding your finger around on the overlay doesn't feel funny.  The adhesive on the overlay doesn't leave any icky residue on the trackpad if you remove it.With the original 1.x version of the software there were a lot of quirks.  Things like a massive calculator appearing (2-4x normal size), issues switching between modes, slow response.  It was annoying enough that I gave up trying to use any of the Magic Numpad functionality even though I left the overlay on the trackpad.Under the 2.0 version, some of the quirks have been fixed.  Calculator is now the expected normal size.  It's responsive.  However I'm having a heck of a time getting any of the items to activate when in trackpad mode.  I should be able to tap the upper right corner to switch to numpad mode.  Used to work in 1.x, doesn't right now in 2.0.  If I go to the menu bar and manually switch to numpad mode I can tap that spot to switch to trackpad mode, so the overlay position is correct and it sort of works.Same problem launching the calculator.  It will not launch at all while I'm in trackpad mode.  Manually switch to numpad mode via the menu and then I can tap the calculator spot to bring up and close the calculator.I thought I checked and confirmed it worked correctly when 2.0 first came out, so why it isn't working now I don't know.  I tried restarting the Magic Numpad application and that did no good.  Rebooting isn't really an option at the moment so I don't know if that would fix it.When it does work, it still has some limitations.  You can't program all of the buttons, only a subset.  Trackpad / Numpad toggle is only an option for the top right button.  Calculator is only an option on the button right next to it.  On the NUM20 overlay, there is a button for Delete.  You can set it to either forward delete (how it's pictured) or backward delete, but you can't set any other button to delete.  In other words, you couldn't have one button as forward delete and the other one as backward delete.I don't know if I recommend it or not.  It does work, but for me it's far easier to just use the full sized keyboard.  Maybe if I had the smaller keyboard, but with the full size keyboard there really isn't any need for it.  I'm going to leave the overlay on the trackpad, but probably won't mess with it much until the next software version releases.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fantastic idea, poor software", "unixReviewTime": 1340841600, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2012"}

I think that even at base ISO, the S100's detail rendition is as good as that of my G10 (which is almost as good as the excellent 50D DSLR). In that regard, it's wonderful, capable of taking images which very few could tell were taken by a small sensor camera.Performance at higher ISOs is also surprisingly good, far surpassing that of the G10. Up to ISO 400, image noise is no problem unless one wants to make a moderately large print, 12X18 inches or more. Even then (at 400) a modest touch of noise reduction preserves all the detail while eliminating visible noise. At ISO 1000 or 1250, very good images are obtainable, when noise reduction is applied. At 1600 and above, color rendition drops off and noise becomes a problem for anything more than small web displays.There have been a few mild criticisms of the ergonomics of the S100, but I think those criticisms are probably the result of people trying to use it for an hour or so and finding the interface slightly different. After using the camera for a day or two, one almost never needs to access the menus. Aperture, shutter speed, ISO, white balance, and exposure comensation can be set so they're \"right out in the open\" for the photographer who needs to change something quickly during a shoot. Even with my XL size hands, using the camera is easy and comfortable.For me, the S100 is not really a \"shirt pocket compact\", and it's only a \"trousers pocket compact\" if the trousers are pretty large, with roomy pockets. But it is small, and it rides comfortably in a small Sony camera case, looped onto my belt.The S100's limitations probably would not be noticed by a casual family photographer. Focus is not as rapid as it is with a DSLR. Shutter lag is noticeable, even with pre-focus. Dynamic range isn't as broad as that of a large sensor camera. These are limitations common to almost all small sensor cameras.Finally, there's no \"hot shoe\" which could accomodate an external flash unit, and the camera's small built-in flash is of very limited use. The workaround is to use an external flash as a slave unit, but that does complicate things a little.There is no perfect camera,but for a small, very portable camera, it's almost impossible to beat the S100.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Actually 4.5 stars for a compact", "unixReviewTime": 1335139200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2012"}

Yes, I can take technically better photographs with them - but only in limited circumstances! If I want a picture of a goldfinch at my feeder, this is the camera I grab!  The pictures this takes are so good, and the camera is SO versatile, it's just FUN!  I don't worry about changing lenses, changing settings, or getting tripods.  I can respond to almost any situation just by zooming and pressing the shutter button.  The DIGIC-V processor/HS sensor used in the camera really makes the most of the 35x zoom.  The images show remarkably little digital noise - almost to the quality of my first dSLR!  And the integral anti-shake image-stabilization makes that monster-zoom range entirely useful!  I took a photograph indoors at night with room lighting - no flash - at full-zoom.  That's the equivalent of an 840mm telephoto on an old 35mm film camera.  The SX40 HS used a shutter speed of 1/20 of a second with a film speed equivalent of 1250 - and it looked good.  No tripod.  No blur (at least, not on my computer screen).  I was ecstatic!  PLUS - the camera I got was still made in Japan (which I happen to find reassuring).  If you want RAW picture files (a common criticism of the Powershots, because they don't use them), you'll have to make up your own mind whether to splurge for one of the competition's models.

Center sharpness is good. Edge sharpness, even at F/8 is a bit soft. Shooting into bright light, the Sony is prone to flare and noticeable fringing near the image edges. Neither is bad enough to be a deal breaker. This makes a pretty good portrait lens, where edge sharpness isn't that important anyway. It also works well shooting theater rehearsals where center sharpness is most important and the low light capability and image stabilization are the most important qualities.When compared to my old manual Pentax 50mm 1.7 lens with an adaptor, the Pentax is so much sharper, with better contrast, that, the comparison is not fair. On the other hand, the Sony lens does have very capable image stabilization and focuses quickly and accurately. I compared the Sony lens with the Sigma 30mm E-mount lens and the Sigma is somewhat sharper, center frame, at all apertures, and a lot sharper at the image edges. Again, the Sigma lacks the IS, but does focus quickly. It is also a bit over a stop slower.One other point: The Pentax 50mm lens, including adaptor, is actually a couple of mm shorter than the Sony lens. It's a shame that we have such small and lightweight cameras with such bulky lenses. Samsung NX cameras are similar in size to the NEX series and Samsung has managed to make some pretty good and small prime lenses, so it is possible when made a corporate priority.

{"reviewerID": "A3ER9SQUEG3440", "asin": "B005P5UMVM", "reviewerName": "K. Owen", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Similar to Maureen Swan's review of this product, I'm reviewing the $199.99 Hauppauge 1445 HD-PVR Gaming Edition (same as the normal version, which is $179.99, but with a special cable used to connect to various consoles) from the perspective of recording games from game consoles only. More specifically, I'm attempting Wii video recording.Firstly, a disclaimer: I'm not a huge recording buff, so don't expect much fancy lingo in this review. I got this product because I love recording \"casual\" playthroughs of games I like, and until now have made do with emulating games on the PC and recording them with Fraps. I figured it was time to move to recording physical games I own, so I bought this.FIRST GLANCEUnboxing the product, I discovered five components: the Hauppauge HD-PVR itself, a USB 2.0 connector for connecting the Hauppauge device to a PC, the power supply, and 2 more cables used for connecting the Hauppauge HD-PVR to the target recording device (one being the 3-in-1 cable that connects to the Xbox 360, PS3 or Wii). There is also a CD that contains special software for recording. The Hauppauge itself seemed a bit dirty on top and is, unfortunately, plastic and cheap-looking. But as we know, not everything appears as it seems, and in a bit I'll explain how the device handles.On the front of the device, the HD-PVR has a power button and the following connectors: SVideo, and the traditional Video (yellow), Left sound (White) and Right sound (Red) plugs. On the back, we have the following connectors: Stereo audio, Component Video, Optical audio. There are two sets of these, one being for game consoles and the other being for TV. The back also contains the USB port that connects the Hauppauge to the PC, and the power supply connector. There is also a Blaster port on the back, but I am not sure what that is used for.INSTALLING SOFTWAREFollowing the included instructions, I hooked the Hauppauge up to the computer and began installing the software on the CD. As outlined in the instructions, the setup software did not pop up immediately (I'm running Windows 7 64-bit), and I navigated to the Setup.exe file on the CD to continue. I proceeded to install device drivers for the HD-PVR, as well as the ArcSoft ShowBiz software. I also decided to register my Hauppauge, but the registration option on the CD software menu didn't seem responsive, so I skipped registration.Just to make sure, though, I went to the Hauppauge website at [...] to download the latest drivers for the HD-PVR. Unzipping and installing the newest drivers was straightforward. Hauppauge provides release notes on the website for the driver updates, which is nice.PREPARING HARDWAREFollowing the included instructions, I hooked up the test console (Nintendo Wii) to the Hauppauge using the 3-in-1 game console connector, and my small 19\" TV (a pittance, I know, but I'm a college student so I have to travel lightly!) to the Hauppauge using the other 5-connector cable. The connections are labeled and color-coded for convenience. Hardware setup was a snap, but there is a lot of hardware involved in this setup.PREPARING TO CAPTUREOpened the ArcSoft ShowBiz software and changed to the Capture tab, then switched on my Wii. Black screen at first, but then I changed the input options to the following and it showed up on my screen:Source: Hauppauge HD PVR Capture DeviceVideo input: YPbPrAudio input: RCA BackPC Audio Mode: 2 Channel Stereo (AC3)There appears to be no lag at all in the transmission of video from the Wii to the Hauppauge to my PC. Excellent! There's a preview screen that shows on the Capture tab in the ShowBiz recording software and it will be \"behind\" timewise compared to the actual display on the TV, so keep that in mind. That said, the preview is very smooth and the sound is amazing. One thing I noticed is that you have the option of choosing where the recorded videos go (so in theory, you could record them to an external hard drive if desired).CAPTURINGThis is where the review goes a bit downhill, but again, this is for the Wii only. I hear many glorious things about recording PS3 and Xbox 360 footage with this thing, so don't discount it just yet. The software and settings took a bit of time to wrap my head around, but I ended up using the standard Wii Composite Video cable (the yellow, white, red connectors that attach to the Wii) and plugging it into the HD-PVR's front Video and Left/Right Sound plugs (instead of using the 3-in-1 cable provided in the box). That said, you might not want to spend the extra $20 on the Gaming Edition for the 3-in-1 cable, but it could be that the Xbox 360 and PS3 don't have proper composite cables. I haven't researched those yet since I have yet to claim ownership of them.Some additional pointers:-Capturing at 13.5 Bit Rate will give you the best quality, and the file size was not considerably large either. Then again, the test video I produced (see below for link) was just over 2 minutes, so keep that in mind.-The Wii is NOT for recording HD. There is a reason why the Hauppauge advertising keeps mentioning the PS3 and Xbox 360, trust me. Don't expect the highest-level recordings for Wii games.-Occasionally, the ArcSoft ShowBiz software will hang in Windows 7. This is not a huge issue, but it becomes a very large one when the program refuses to quit (unkillable process) despite what you may do to it. Never found a workaround for this aside from restarting the computer, which is frustrating.-If you want good quality videos, do NOT use ShowBiz to publish them. Just trust me on this. I've heard you have to have at least 720p video clips recorded at 60 fps to even have the option to publish at that level, but I haven't gotten to test it yet. Again, this is all from the standpoint of trying to publish lower-quality Wii videos that were recorded off of the Hauppauge.-The recorded sound is flawless. It sounds exactly like it does in games. This is one area where, regardless of my Wii recording problems, the Hauppauge has satisfied me completely. However, make sure you adjust the sound properly (I used 2 channels with AC3, not AAC) and do some sample recordings to get the best sound out of a recording.TEST VIDEOHere is an example video I recorded off of a Wii game (Technically a Gamecube game) using the Hauppauge HD-PVR: watch?v=utaiFZTSzzE (youtube video)The video is Tales of Symphonia's intro movie. I ended up recording it using the .M2TS format (which fits the Playstation 3 playback criteria) due to some issues with movie editing. The file size was amazingly small, but I'm used to Fraps recording on the PC and compared to that, it's miniscule.VERDICTMy standards for recording were quite low, so for now this is better than most things can put out, I imagine. I expect to make much better use of it for PC, PS3 and/or Xbox 360 recordings. Just be warned that it is not easy at all (possibly not feasible) to get HD or high-quality recordings of Wii games. The software is passable but not outstanding, yet it meets my needs for now. It almost never lags or has recording problems (aside from possible ones when you first press \"Record\"), and the sound it records is beautiful and seamless.In conclusion, the Hauppauge HD-PVR has a lot of potential, it just isn't realized when recording non-HD content.I will update this review more as I move on to other games or discover more tricks for recording well.--------------------UPDATE: February 2012I have procured a Playstation 3 and tested recording as high as my TV would go (1080i, which is not as smooth as 1080p but still HD) and it is very impressive. I recorded the intro and title screen for Rune Factory Tides of Destiny for the PS3: watch?v=7Mr5DuW1Kgg (youtube video).The recording is of absolutely breathtaking quality (at least in my eyes) coupled with smooth recording and amazing sound. However, it did take a bit of fiddling around with TV and capture settings, and I ended up using the YPbPr cable (the game console connection cable that came with the Hauppauge HD PVR) for Video input when capturing, which plugs into the back of the HD PVR. Still, it was hardly a problem and the result is amazing.This changes my rating for this device to 5 stars instead of 4, as now the full potential of the Hauppauge is apparent to me. Totally recommended if you plan on recording HD gameplay. You get what you pay for, and while the Hauppauge certainly looks physically mediocre, it's actually very powerful and smooth-operating.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing for HD content, satisfactory for non-HD content", "unixReviewTime": 1326326400, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2012"}

The sound has all the feel of a movie theater, with clarity, depth, and the rich bass of the separate sub-woofer (even when turned down so that my family, relaxing rooms away, can hear their own thoughts). The sound is a clear, clean, immersion of sound that turns anything you watch into an experience. Be sure to follow the recommended placement of the sound bar: ON THE FLOOR and not on the TV stand in front of the TV! Surround-sound immersion from the floor is greatly enhanced!I have tried (without success) to watch and enjoy HD TV and Blu-Ray DVD's with the the woefully inadequate standard-equipment sound that came with the TV.So I carefully weighed my options, and then the options of each individual sound bar that I investigated. (I didn't want to run wires with an amp and speakers).  Then I went to where they were on display to hear them in person. The Vizio sounded great, and also had a few extra features in particular that won me over. First, it offers 3 HDMI ports, two input, a one pass-thru output port (ARC Compatible). It also has a digital audio input. But the selling point for me was its 3.5mm (iPod or similar) jack, so that I can hear my CD's and/or MP3's through these great speakers. Compared to the TV's original speakers, the VHT215 is the audio difference between VHS and Blu-Ray. It is just that good!Some previous reviews complained of problems with the HDMI pass-thru. Let me tell you my experience: I ran my DVD player's and my Satellite Box's HDMI outputs thru the Vizio, and into my TV input. When I did that, there was hesitation (processing?) when changing channels, and in the DVD Player's playing of movies. I did not like that.Then, (it may have been my own lack of familiarity with the Unit), but when a DVD was done, there was also hesitation in processing the return to passing thru the signal from the Satellite Box. Some times it ran the sound only, and then the picture finally came on after 20 or 30 seconds. To resolve the issue, I disconnected the two HDMI inputs, ran them both directly to the TV (as originally connected) and then I ran the sound from the TV to the Sound Bar through a digital audio cable. All of the positive aspects of the sound is now back, with none of the HDMI processing hesitations.However, I did not consider the above minor \"glitches\" enough of a problem to drop my rating down from 5-stars to 4-stars. I didn't buy this Unit to decipher High Definition and Blu-Ray visual signals. I bought the Vizio VHT215 Sound Bar for a better SOUND, and this Unit has lived up to AND exceeded my expectations. The sound is 5-star sound! And when you place it on the floor: 6-star!If you're not sure, buy it from a Seller who will allow you to hear it for yourself at home for a reasonable amount of time, and return it if not satisfied. But I am very satisfied with this purchase. And, I recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Satisfying Sound Immersion", "unixReviewTime": 1341273600, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2012"}

The second strap for holding while reading is thoughtful, but it seems more comfortable to hold it open like a proper book instead.Could be better with a pocket for storing a charger or maybe small documents, but I don't think any of the tablet cases I've looked at had that.

The next logical step is buy another Linksys product, they are very reliable.  The E2500 installed quickly and easily.  However my plans were to split  my video traffic and Internet traffic.  I then ran into a couple of challenges.  First, I assumed that my new Sony KDL60EX720 TV supported the 802.11N standard, it did.  However the TV will only function on the 2.4 Mhz channel and not on the 5 Mhz channel.  Ok, no problem I will place the video traffic on the 2.4 channel and put my Mac(s) printers, iPhones on the 5 Mhz channel.Then I discovered the very limited range of the 5.0 channel.  My daughters Mac is directly one floor above the E2500 router in a wooden framed home and the signal level occasionally falls below a single bar.  It looks like the 5.0 channel is well suited for people who live in a studio apartment, not a two story home.So I have abandoned the 5.0 channel and placed everything on the 2.4 channel and everything works OK, slight improvement over my beloved WRT54G.UPDATE,  March 24, 2012 experimented with changing the 5.0 channels and found a channel (161) that seems to have solved by problem.  But overall the speeds that I am seeing on both channels do not improve over my beloved Linksys WRT54G.FINAL UPDATE:  well I am back to the same old problem that I had with the WRT54G, having to power cycle the E2500 every few days.

Why companies staff their support centers without training the support staff is hard to understand.  call Apple Computers and see the comparison.

Since I do not have a 3D TV or even a 3D Blu Ray player (but have movies) at the same time I ordered a Panasonic 3D Blu Ray Player from Amazon.  They both arrived the same day.I am a 3d still photographer, not a gamer, not a videographer.  I have been shooting 3d pictures since 1988, first film (starting with a Stereo Realist and moving to more expensive and advanced 3d cameras) and for the last 2  years digital, starting with the Fuji W1 and gradually building up to more and better equipment.  I looked into this unit to view my own 3d pictures and also to watch 3D Blu Ray movies that I have been buying like crazy lately.Considering the cost of the Sony viewer, I had done a bit of research.  Reading user's impressions it was clear that the unit has a problem with comfort (the way it fits in the head) but most people were happy with the image.  It was not clear if and how I would use it to view my own personal 3d pictures.When my unit arrived, first thing I did was to watch parts of 3d movies.  Then I put an SD card to the Panasonic player and played some of my own stereo pictures.  Finally, I plugged the unit into my laptop.Here are my impressions:1. Yes, there is a problem with the way the unit fits.  Sony made the mistake NOT to distribute the weight but leave it all in the front.  I am a runner and I wear head-mounted LED lights to run at night.  The best units are the ones that have the battery pack in the back of the head, distributing the weight uniformly between front and back.  It is a mistake to leave all the way in the front.  In addition, the nose gap is not well designed and the weight puts pressure right on your nose.  And, if you don't position the unit perfectly, you get blurry edges in the image.  Positioning the unit perfectly is not easy.2. The resolution (1280x720 per eye) is OK. I can see the pixels, so there is room for improvement.  HD resolution would be great.3. Optics are OK.  But I can see chromatic aberration.  Sometimes I notice it, other times I don't so I can live with it.4. The unit has a menu where you can turn 3D on and you only have two choices, side by side or over under.  The side by side option expects an image that is compressed 50% horizontally.  It would help to have more options.  Plus, the headset is connected to a control unit that needs to be plugged to AC power and to the unit sending the signal, so the setup is not portable at all.Despite these issues, I love it.  :)There is nothing like that around and it is the first step in the right direction.  With improvements in the design and quality (resolution, etc), this will make a great digital 3d viewer, something that we are all waiting for.  No ghosting, vivid colorful high resolution digital images.Watching 3d movies was fun.  Actually, even the previews that were in 2d looked great in this unit.  Just like being in the theater.When I put the SD card in the Panasonic unit, it would only recognize MPO files as being 3d.  So I pulled the SD card out of my Fuji W3 camera and my Panasonic GF2 (that has MPO files from when I use the 3D Lens), and watched over 1000 stereo images.  That was fun! (Even though the MPOs were not aligned). I later discovered that I can even watch the .jpg images in the SD card in 3d, after I turn the Sony's 3D on, but only pictures squeezed 50% display properly.  This is not a format that I normally use.Finally, I connected my laptop to the Sony.  I was expecting problems, but I was able to make things work by playing with the resolution settings (under Windows 7).  I used these settings: - Multiple monitors, 1280x720 - Duplicate these displays.Then I turned Sony's 3D side by side mode on.  Stereoscopic Player and StereoPhoto Maker (both in full screen) displayed images in 3d.  But, in Stereoscopic Player I changed the aspect ratio to 50% (I could not find a similar setting in SPM, so SPM images are stretched 100%).  The resolution of the images in the Stereoscopic Player was not good.  In the process of compressing the image and then expanding it, something is lost, apparently.These are my experiences with the unit so far from using the unit for a couple of hours.  The unit works well for watching 3d movies. There are ways to see my own 3d pictures, either as MPO files in an SD card, or formatted at 50% aspect ratio horizontally jpg files.  I would like to find a better way to see my 3d pictures when connected to my laptop.I enjoyed the experience and I expect to use the unit quite a bit and then trade it for the next upgrade that will hopefully address some of the problems of this unit.  Ideally, the perfect digital 3d viewer should be more portable, higher resolution, fit nicely over the head or even be light enough to hold it in front of your eyes (if you elect to do that).I was debating whether to rate this unit 4 or 5 stars.  Since the unit is not perfect, 4 stars would be a more fair rating, but, without competition, this stands out as a league of its own, so it deserves a 5 star rating.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not without problems but a great first start", "unixReviewTime": 1327449600, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2012"}

The integrated GPU is the star of this machine, it is supposed to better than old ion that you see so many of.  It also plays h264 HD files beautifully when supported and once you turn on the settings for HD online videos, also the dual core processor is supposed to be fast for a netbook.Now my concerns, I was under the impression that the C 60 dual core would be pretty fast in comparison to the prevalent single core atoms, but I am struggling to see the difference really in everyday tasks including browsing and the usual work related task such as word processing and excel, in fact Firefox is noticeably slower to start which is puzzling.  If I play video that is supported by the GPU then it runs silky smooth, however you play video that are not supported such as 10 bit h264, or even 360p resolution VP3 youtube files then it seriously choppy.With my old netbook which doesn't have a media dedicated GPU, I could play regular common 8 bit 720p h264 video smoothly with the right settings, and my old netbook also gives a good account of itself with 10 bit 720 h264 .  However, I tried the same settings on this Acer machine and while 8 bit 720p video was silky smooth thanks to the GPU, the 720p 10 bit(which is not supported by the GPU) was a lot choppier despite the supposedly faster CPU.I want to use this machine for at least 3 years if I can, and video playing is important to me.  H265 (new media standard) products and adoption should be the norm by the end of 2013 b/c of the urgent need for compression for mobile networks.  With this upcoming turn over for online videos from h264 to h265, I am now thinking that there is no way the C 60 processor can handle h265, which I naively thought the C60 would give a good account of itself, but that is totally unrealistic.  Thus by 2013, online video will probably not work that well on this relatively new machine b/c there are no h265 enable devices on the market right now, and the CPU won't cut it.I put my old netbook on sale, with the intention using the funds from the sale to eventually paying off a large percentage of this purchase, but I am now thinking to keep my old netbook to hold me over to 2013, and return the Acer aspire b/c it isn't really a marked improvement in what I use my netbooks for which is Microsoft Office related work and video playing.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not Sure about this one, Movie Playing", "unixReviewTime": 1336780800, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2012"}

Always \"disk error\" on boot, or complete system freeze after only a few minutes.  This was consistent whether I loaded Win7, OpenSUSE, or Ubuntu as the primary operating system.So I bought a Corsair Nova Series-2 SSD.  It was very reliable (it would boot and not freeze), but the performance was pathetic.  In my \"Win7 experience\" rating, my Corsair SSD was the BOTTLENECK in my system. A SSD ought to be the FASTEST component.  My rating was a pathetic 5.2 - because of my pathetic SSD.  Every other subsystem scored above 7 - but my disk subsystem (with this crappy SSD drive) pulled me down to 5.1.  The Corsair forums are full of people who are hopping mad because of the lousy performance of this drive.I had purchased THREE SSD drives from respected memory manufacturers, with poor results.  So I quit looking at labels and prices, and began an in-depth analysis of current SSD technology in terms of reliability and performance, as rated by respected authorities such as AnandTech and TomsHardware, and also by studying the published manufacturer's specs.One thing that I discovered is that size really does matter in SSDs.  Smaller size equals significantly reduced performance.  64GB drives are substantially slower than their larger counterparts. I have no idea why this is so, but it is plainly true - even the manufacturer's own spec sheets show this.I was never able to get either OCZ drive to boot long enough to run benchmarks.  I was able to run benchmarks against the reliable (but slow) Corsair drive - and the results were much lower than expected (and I had come to learn that I should not expect much from a 64GB SSD, but this Corsair SSD drive substantially under-performed 5400-RPM mechanical drives in the same system based on CrystalReport benchmarks).Samsung SSD drives were most highly rated in reliability, and almost as highly rated in performance. I bought this drive in the 128GB size.  My \"Win7 Experience\" rating went from 5.2 to a respectable 7.1 - and the limiting factor is now my graphics card.  My HDD performance is rated the highest of all subsystems (at 7.5 - 7.9 is the current upper limit).  I went from a SSD being the bottleneck to an SSD which is (rightfully) the fastest subsystem.I will no longer buy anything made by OCZ or Corsair - brands which I had previously trusted and respected.

I don't need to burn or even play back Blu-ray discs on my computer, but I want to convert my Blu-ray collection to an Apple TV-friendly format, which will also play on my computer in iTunes.This drive plus the free MakeMKV app fit the bill nicely. MakeMKV converts the movie from the disc to .mkv format, then I use the free Handbrake to convert it to an Apple TV .m4v file.Power is provided with the usual wall wart measuring about 3\" x 2\" x 1\". The provided USB 3.0 cable is only about 3 feet long, but works fine with my USB 2.0 hub. There's a plastic stand if you want to mount it on its side, like in every picture I've ever seen of this drive. I passed on that.With Apple's lack of Blu-ray support, I was impressed that the drive mounted quickly the very first time I popped in a Blu-ray disc, with no software needed. Drag your disc to the Trash, and the drive ejects it promptly.I am also impressed that when hooked up to my little old USB 2.0-only Mac through a USB 2.0 hub, it can rip an entire Blu-ray disc in 50-100 minutes.I wish I could tell you how it works as a Blu-ray burner, but I am unlikely to ever use it for that. This drive was so inexpensive that it beat the price for any USB 3.0 read-only Blu-ray drive I could find. I paid under $90 (including shipping) by adding it to my shopping cart and then watching the price fluctuate for a couple of weeks before buying low.If you want it for simply playing Blu-ray discs on your Mac, you'll have to invest in Blu-ray playback software, as I am unaware of anything free in this category.For Blu-ray disc burning, you'll need Toast or something similar.Only a couple of little things on the down side. This drive gets hot during a rip. The discs can come out surprisingly hot to the touch.The other negative is the placement of the eject button.

Toggling on/off switch, then pushing eject button does the trick.Reducing my rating to 4 stars.UPDATE: The not-ejecting issue was my fault for not using the \"eject\" button within the software I was using, and using the physical button on the drive while the software was still running.I've had it for over a year now and it's still running strong.

I bought it after an extensive research that included USB-3 products from my top three brands: SanDisk, Lexar and Sonnet. I eliminated all three brands, as two of them included some negative aspects and the manufacturer of the third one did not provide me with the satisfactory answer to my pre-sale technical question.There is not much that can be said about a product as simple as a dual (CF/SD) memory card reader. This one is USB-3 / UDMA compliant, includes 3-foot long cable with regular plugs (no mini or micro) on both ends. The CF socket is equipped with a drop-out door that opens automatically when a CF card is inserted. That prevents dirt from getting in and protects delicate contact pins. A card can be inserted as far as about 3/4 of an inch, so there is no worry about bad contact or inaccurate angle of insertion (cards in some other brands of readers can only be inserted by about 1/4 of an inch). The design is rugged and robust, with the aluminum body. Its size is bigger than the size of other brands' comparable products, but I do not care.I am using this reader with my Retina MacBook Pro. The reader works out-of-the-box with no problem whatsoever. I have no way of checking the exact speed of read/write, but the gain in speed over my old USB-2 and FireWire readers is significant. I just downloaded a firmware update from HoodmanUSA.com and it should give me even more speed with my future faster cards.So, for now, total satisfaction.

You can find my review of Fimir 100% bubble free Guaranteed Anti-Glare Screen Protector film Mask IMP65B for Apple iPad 2 2nd Generation (Black) here http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F4NXW6EYHJTP/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm but these are my thoughts on the white version (note: the references to iVisor is theiVisor for iPad 2 - Black (99MO020908)which I also own).Appearance:The Firmir differs from the iVisor in that it has a slit for the camera/light detector rather than the cutout that the iVisor uses and I prefer. The Firmir does seem to be slightly thinner yet stiffer than the iVisor but that may be done to the length of time I've owned the iVisor.Application:As stated this could not be easier to apply. I suggest applying it in a dust-free room, such as a bathroom after you've run the shower for a few minutes, but all you do is clean you iPad screen (the included wet and dry wipes and microfibre cloth is a nice touch), peel off the protective backing and aligh and place on your screen - there will be no bubbles! Just like the iVisor, the Firmir is just a tad smaller than the iPad screen - there will be a tiny amount of screen edge plus the home buttom and camera slit visible. In all honesty, if I had wanted a white iPad I would have bought a white iPad but this is a cheap and cheerful way to change the look of your tablet. Compared to the Firmir, the adhesive around the screen edge is stronger meaning it takes more effort (especially if you are a nail biter like me!) to remove. However, as I mention above, once it is applied I suggest leaving it on.Use:This is an anti-glare screen so please understand that as a trade-off you will lose clarity due to the moire affect. You may notice this most reading web pages and ebooks. The iVisor is the same and I have never been bothered by the loss of clarity - the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint properties of these screens are more beneficial to me. If you are the type that must have a pristine screen, these type of screen protectors are not for you. The Firmir excels at anti-glare, more so than my iVisor. It also has a more matte feeling i.e. it is not as slick feeling as the iVisor which I actually prefer and also helps minimize any fingerprints on the screenSummary:This is an excellent screen protector if, like me, you have trouble applying the adhesive type and like an anti-glare protector. I've only 'dinged' a star due to the camera slit over a cutout.

One thing I cant tell you is that my canon 18-135 mounted on my 60D does search for focus a bit before taking the picture. Another aspect that is important to describe to would be buyers is that the depth of field is a challenge. If you are taking a picture of the insect and you want its whole body to be in focus you will have to place you lens sideways to the insect or some parts of the body will not be that well defined in the picture. On the same token, this is going to be a good leans to use in any situation where the object has what you want to show at a similar distance to the front of your lens but if it is very curvacious, it will be a challenge to take the picture as you want it to be. This may sound very obvious for the experienced photographer but it is not so intuitive (how this lenses impact you macro shots)to the ones that are not doing this for some time. In any case, I recommend these. They are pretty good and deliver the result with no visible distortion. You are also going to find that using the +10 is very hard.

I wanted a set of filters that brought the subject closer as the images on the page implies; what I got was a very sharp set of optics that (for the most part) force me to get closer to the subject. Shame on me primarily for missing \"Macro\" in the title; but the images of the meerkat getting closer from a distance led me to believe the filters brought the subject closer... NOT SO.However, this actually is a pretty good deal for me since much of what I do when I'm not shooting family and landscape is close up and macro; and these are sharp filters. They showed me quite clearly that I need to clean my keyboard. There are, unfortunately, a couple of serious \"detractors.\"Using any of the filters in the +2 and up range (you can stack the +1, +2 and +4 filters for differing effects) result in very noticeable distortion on all sides of the image - bowing inward to the center. Using the +10 is an interesting experience - I had to get within 4\" of the subject (with my lens focused on infinity), and only about 30% of the image center is usable if you want a mostly undistorted image. The other 70% outside the center looks like a radial blur (zoom) effect. (I have placed an image with the testing I did on the product page for those who want to see how the different filters affect images.)Am I going to return them? Not likely. Like I said, they really are sharp and I do have a use for them... even the +10. I do believe Amazon/Agfa need to adjust the images to more accurately convey how these filters are really used.

This uses the layout where the backspace key is smaller and the enter key is a gargantuan beast. I advise looking up pictures of the keys to see what I mean and deciding if you can handle the change.That being said, I love this keyboard. It feels very solid (not afraid to break it). I'd read a lot of reviews that have said that the Cherry MX Black switches are not considered very good for typing, and are mainly geared towards pure gaming. Personally, I find that the CMXB switches are fantastic for everything. I tend to (apparently) type a little heavy-handedly. This is not a problem with this keyboard (at least not yet).The key \"feel\" is fantastic. It feels like someone dug up an old IBM beast-board from the monolith era and rebuilt it from scratch with the latest tech. The result is a very smooth, uniform key motion, and the only noise is the clack of the key backing hitting the end of the keystroke. It sounds awesome for those who like the sounds of yester-year. More importantly, it is responsive, durable, and well-designed.I haven't had any of the software issues some of the other reviewers have noted. I plugged it in, it installed a basic driver. I went to the AZIO website and downloaded the latest version software. I installed said software. Everything just works. I am running Win7 x64.If I had to make a feature request, it would be adjustable full-keyboard backlighting. As things are, the volume knob has a light, the numlock key is a short step away from being a lightsaber (super bright!), and the macro keys can light up.All in all, I highly recommend this keyboard to anyone. It took me a little bit of adjustment to deal with the backspace/enter key changes. Within a week, I was adjusted. I don't even notice when I switch back and forth between configurations anymore.

It is a powered antenna but rather bulky, hard to hide beside/behind the TV.Enter the Winegard FL-5000.  This antenna is very lightweight, about the thickness of a 5 1/4\" floppy disk, and has a white side and a black side.  Unfortunately the cable coming from it is black so it still doesn't hide too well on a white wall.  It also includes sticky velcro pads to stick it to whatever surface you want.Using the signal meter on my TV I tried 3 channels (including one I had trouble receiving) at 3 different locations.  The FL-5000 is much easier to try different locations than bulkier antennas.  I first tried it on the wall behind the TV but found you really need to decide the final spot before sticking it, because I pulled some paint off my wall when removing the antenna.  I wound up using thumbtacks after that, much easier to clean up after.  Second spot I tried was on the back of the TV, I didn't get good signal from there.  I wound up with the antenna mounted on the wall right below the ceiling.Here are the readings from my old antenna, on a windy evening:Channel 29:  72 to 82Channel 35:  83 to 92Channel 6:  32 to 65Obviously channel 6 was the weak one.And the Winegard FL-500 in it's final location, same windy evening:Channel 29:  63 to 75Channel 35:  71 to 78Channel 6:  78 to 83As you can see 29 and 35 got a little worse but still acceptable.

I have a room with a beautiful hd tv but don't have any cable wired to that room so its always been just a dvd player tv.While the antenna is very thin, (just a bit thicker than construction paper but made of plastic) no matter where I placed it, it didn't get a signal.

For experienced users you can completely ignore the included software and get the basic functions as NAS device working without using the software CD (My Book Live Discovery Software + SmartWare etc;) that is provided with the product.If you know how to browse your network and discover the IP address of WD Live Duo you can map network drives and start using the \"public\" share to store and access you data as guest user without setting up users and additional NAS shares etc;The \"public\" folder also contains the needed software and you can install all the applications like SmartWare and other packages for windows and Mac to the attached PC's.For others who are not technically inclined, thankfully the include CD \"setup\" process guides you thru' the full process of setting up your WD Live Duo on your home network.The included \"SmartWare\" software provides features like backing up your PCs connected to your home network. Software works well and the user interface is simple to use. If you really want to use it to backup your PC files it does work. FYI - It does take considerable amount of time to do a full PC backup. But thankfully, you can customize the time and select the need directories and let it backup when your PC is idle.Personal Cloud feature:=======================This is new buzz word now-a-days that everyone wants to have it in their product.

A \"personal cloud\" is your \"own data\" like photos and or that video file of your vacation that you secure at your own location and on your WD Live DUO hard disks and completely under your control. Unlike public clouds which are being offered by multitude of hosted services companies these days, a \"personal cloud\" feature allows you to keep all your data in one safe place inside your home. Other things you can do are sharing of these files with your family members, streaming these media files remotely, and ability to access your content via Internet from anywhere. Bottom-line: No monthly fees. No \"unknown\" strange location where your personal data resides. That is \"Personal Cloud\".WD's \"2go\" web access software app provides fee-free remote access from My Book Live Duo personal cloud storage. You need to register your device with your name and email, Instructions will be sent by WD via email how to activate it. Once you log in, WD \"2go\" software mounts My Book Live Duo to your computer like a local drive and your remote folders from your \"personal cloud\" are available on your Mac or PC.The speed at which you can access your files fully depends on how fast internet connection (Upload speeds are important here) you have at home as well as how fast Internet connectivity (Download speeds are important here) you have at the remote location where you attempted to mount your personal cloud.For most small document transfers, uploading downloading few photos and files it is just perfect. Just do not expect to stream that Hi-definition Blu-Ray Rip remotely :-)Suggestions:============In order to maximize performance you need to disable the services that you do not want to use. For example: I do not want this to be my \"Itunes\" Server so I disabled it. I also did not use the Media Streaming (DLNA) features so that the box is not busy with those additional tasks.Most of my PC's and Media streaming devices on my home network are capable of mounting SAMBA NAS shares. So there was no real need for WD Live Duo to stream via DLNA.If you want you can pair this up withWestern Digital WD TV Live Streaming Media Playerand you will be very happy with the results. WD TV Live Streaming Media Player is excellent when it comes to playback of multitude of media files and thisWestern Digital My Book Live Duo 4 TB Personal Cloud Storage Driveis an excellent storage device.Do not expect to change RAID 0 (SPAN) to RAID 1 (Mirror) instantaneously, the rebuild process takes a very long time (But you can still access the files while the rebuilt takes place in the background with some performance hit)Verdict:========This Product is awesome! - 4  stars!Important Information:======================FYI- There were some batches of WD Live Duo wherein WD did not populate the correct files in the software directory and users got \"Runtime\" errors when attempting to install the software. Please see my comments section how to resolve that issue.Thanks for reading my review and please feel free to comment if you have any questions.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent NAS Product!", "unixReviewTime": 1329782400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2012"}

I decided I needed TTL after seeing a few totally ruined photos that would've been perfect if I had remembered to change my output with my zooming.I really like the TTL.  I like the fact that you can take the flash +/- 3 Exposure Bias to drop down into the fill flash category.The AF assist beam makes the price alone worth it.  Are you tired of your DSLR 'hunting' for focus in dark situations?  The laser grid this thing projects is extremely useful.  To test how smart it was I went into my bathroom turned all the lights off and the beam made the camera grab focus in roughly the same time it did with the lights on.The quality of light is very clean and the head articulates for all the necessary angles.Works with all of canon's TTL Flash Control menus no problem.Build quality feels on par with the 18-55 kit lens that comes with the entry level DSLRs nowadays.  Not much metal but no foreseeable problems.This is a bit smaller than the yn560/canon 580 series which is nice.I highly recommend this to help get better focus in dark situations and forget about adjusting flash all the time.

Trust me when I say it wasn't easy but it was worth the trouble. This tablet is by far the most advanced and fastest tablet on the market (IOS or Android). That doesn't mean it's perfect because no tech product is. Those out there looking for a device that never has bugs or issues might as well stop now because you'll never find something to your liking. What I can say is that ASUS did a fine job with putting this together. I won't touch on every aspect of the Transformer Prime but here are some highlights:Screen- This screen is bright and beautiful. You can set the Super IPS display if you're outdoors but otherwise, the regular brightness is perfectly fine. The resolution is the same as most 10.1 inch tablets and is crisp and clear.Speed- This tablet has a Tegra 3 quad-core processor and it is blazing. You can multi-task to your hearts delight and it won't skip a beat. It opens applications faster than any phone or tablet I can think of. The encouraging news is that they are still really developing apps for the Tegra 3 so when that becomes more relevant this thing will be even better. Scrolling and touch sensitivity is \"buttery\" smooth with no lag whatsoever.Build- This is a very aesthetically pleasing device. What I mean is that it is an eye-catcher. Brushed aluminum backing and super thin, it looks fantastic. It's light and the weight balance is perfect when holding with one hand or two. Gorilla glass screen means that you won't have to worry about scratches. Those out there that complain about fingerprints need to realize that this is the case for 99% of tablets out there. (HINT: use the microfiber cloth that comes with it)Storage and Connectivity- One of the biggest selling points was the storage space. 32gb of onboard memory PLUS it has a micro-sd card slot for expansion. This thing can become an entertainment powerhouse.  It has a micro-hdmi out so you can connect to TVs or projectors. This means you can watch Netflix and other movies on a bigger screen if you'd prefer. You won't have to buy a proprietary cables just to connect. Of course, the big sell is the laptop dock accessory. I personally don't need it but its a great option if you want a netbook like experience. Oh yeah, you can also use PS3 or USB gaming controllers with this to play games!Battery Life- So I haven't done an \"official\" battery test but in my usage so far I easily get a couple days out of this tablet. It obviously depends on what the settings are (i.e. screen brightness, power mode) but trust me when I say that if you go on a long trip with this thing you'll be good to go with juice to spare.Ice Cream Sandwich- This may not matter in a month or two but it is currently one of a select few devices that has the latest operating system of Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich. I won't get into all the details of what ICS is but I can say that it is user friendly and has loads of potential.Side notes:Ok, so a lot of people may have heard about certain users having issues with WIFI and/or GPS. On my end, I haven't had a single issue with WIFI. The signal is always strong even at a good distance away from the router. I think this just may be an isolated issue with some of the devices. I don't think this is indicative of all the tablets. I haven't used the GPS much but I can guess that the all-aluminum backing has something to do with the issues its having catching signals from satellites. Honestly though, it's ridiculous to use this as a standalone GPS device.As a heads-up, this tablet is currently (as of 2/21) extremely hard to come by. It is sold out at most, if not all retailers. I'm sure ASUS will eventually be able to keep up with demand but be warned that you may not be able to get one for a while. This obviously is a result of the shortsightedness of ASUS and should bear no negative reflection on the tablet itself.The Verdict:So is this worth $499.99 of your hard earned money? If you're looking for the best tablet available then the answer is a definitive YES. It's certainly worth more for your money than ANY tablet at and around its price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Tablet Currently Available", "unixReviewTime": 1329782400, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2012"}
{"reviewerID": "A2II3I4UU6QL2D", "asin": "B0067PLM5E", "reviewerName": "JCO", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "A few years ago I purchased an ASUS Netbook based on the premise that it provided superior portability for web surfing at a reasonable price. Wrong. Yes, it was small and light, but the need to fold it as well as the limits of battery life in my experience significantly compromised what I could do on the road. Add to that the Windows operating system and an underpowered Intel Atom CPU and it made for a miserable surfing and computing experience, whether on the road or not.Fast forward to late November of 2011 when I first heard of another robust ASUS ultra portable computer in the form of a tablet running on the Android platform and you can imagine I was skeptical, especially at the price points mentioned in the press and with the claims that HD quality video would run smoothly, that surfing included fast screen updates, and that the tablet delivered an enjoyable gaming experience.  After considering that I had an Amazon gift card for $100, but recognizing that Amazon appeared to have stopped taking orders and the fact that I had an upcoming vacation trip for which it was necessary to travel light, I took my chances and ordered the Transformer Prime from B&H; on November 25. B&H; could not provide a reliable shipping date or even explain if they shipped on the basis of who placed orders first. Thus I indicated my travel destination as the shipping address thinking there was no way the product would take that long to ship. Wrong again. Weeks later, when it was clear that my vacation would end before I received the tablet, I asked B&H; to change the shipping address to my home. B&H; explained they could do that but that would place me at the end of the line, which was apparently established after my initial call. I had previously had good experience with B&H;, but it was very disappointing to hear this. Considering the experience and the still unused Amazon gift certificate, it was easy for me to cancel the order through B&H; to order through Amazon instead. I have never had a problem with Amazon and they just happened to have started taking orders again. I placed the order in late December and it arrived on about the 14th of January nicely boxed to prevent damage during transit.I unpacked, quickly went through the abbreviated user guide, charged the unit as directed, and the following day attempted to run the setup to link to my wireless home network. Based on news accounts and Transformer Forums I was concerned about problems with both GPS and wireless connectivity. I hoped my experience would be uneventful, but it was not to be. When the setup attempted to log into my Gmail account, it was apparent to me that I probably had hours of troubleshooting ahead of me. I had some hope, however, that since the Transformer Prime was connecting to the home network but failing at the point of internet access, that my problem would be easier to diagnose and fix. I did a fair number of fruitless Google searches before I resorted to ASUS customer support. ASUS had me reboot my router (which I had just updated the firmware for) and then walked me through the process of resetting the Android software. Still no luck. Customer support told me I had two options at that point: one, send them the Transformer Prime for repair since they concluded it was faulty or, two, return it to Amazon for an exchange or refund. These options were provided to me after no more than 5 minutes of conversation and I was surprised that ASUS was not suggesting other options. I reminded the representative that I was able to establish a wireless network connection and that the issue was simply internet access. He was insistent that the problem was the tablet and I didn't argue. Nonetheless I was determined to try other options before returning the tablet.I started by driving to a nearby mall, figuring that if I could connect to the internet there I would have some assurance that the tablet was not the problem. Within seconds of my turning on the tablet, I did indeed establish the internet connection while sitting in my car about 30 feet from the nearest building. I completed the setup, went to the settings menu, saw that there was an update available, and proceeded to download and install what turned out to be Android 4.0_. I then drove home monitoring the access points and signal strength along the way. I was very surprised by the number of unsecured access points in residential areas. I hope that people are taking precautions in safeguarding their privacy and data.When I got home I called my internet service provider to make sure that there were no service interruptions. I was assured there were none. I then powered on the tablet hopeful that the operating system update solved my problems. It did not. At that point I knew the problem was my router. Since I purchased my D-Link 655 from Costco at a time they had a promotion that provided free lifetime technical support, I wasted no time in getting them on the phone. Within 30 minutes of trial and error testing, we traced the problem to an IP address for the router that limited functionality. We changed that and immediately had the Transformer Prime on the internet.One thing I am extremely thankful for is the free router technical assistance. I have an extremely complicated home network with multiple routers, switches, and extenders for both wired and wireless connectivity. We also have multiple media servers and at any one time can have more than 10 devices competing for wired and wireless bandwidth. My technical knowledge is limited and as much as I enjoy tweaking, a prime consideration for me in any future router purchase will be the availability of free technical support for those times that I can't troubleshoot a problem.As to the Transformer Prime, now that I've put it through hours of use, I'm impressed. I have not taken it on a trip yet, but I can happily trip through my home and yard while surfing without problems. The available aps are numerous, performance far exceeds that of a netbook, the screen is gorgeous, and while I have experienced occasional browser crashes, they are thus far tolerable and I hope fixed in future software releases.This is what the Netbook should have been.I recommend a Griffin stylus and a stand to go with the mini HDMI cable in your accessory kit. I am still waiting for the leather jacket that I will protect the tablet in.

You need to make the drive on your system go through two or three boots, because until you show it what files you use regularly it doesn't know what to speed up. The system works out which are the most-used files and makes a copy of them in the SSD area, so that when you come to start Windows, for instance, the files will be read instantaneously as opposed to the files being located and read from the platters. That speeds up things, but by how much? In other words, is it worth you getting some sort of SSD?The answer is definitely yes, but the speed improvement varies by the type of SSD setup you have. In order of my using them, the 500GB 7,200 rpm all platter drive worked OK. When I went to an equivalent drive with 4GB SSD, it seemed that boot times were almost cut in half. Then the new computer arrived, which had the latest performance chip (the 2500K), and everything was on the SSD. This gave a massive speed boost, with Windows and Application boot times at almost instantaneous speeds. I didn't check the times with a stopwatch, but speed times were down to the point where you couldn't ignore the machine, otherwise it would sit there waiting for you. The mechanical boot time (i.e. the time before Windows starts) is longer on my new machine, and Windows is 64-bit rather than 32-bit.It looks as though my 120GB SSD will run just about all of the programs I want. Windows 64-bit is around 30GB (Windows 32-bit is around 20GB). I also have Microsoft Office Pro (all programs, including Access and Publisher), Waterfox (Firefox for 64-bit), a bunch of freeware programs, and games like Civ 5 and Skyrim. All of that takes up 41.5 GB leaving me with 70GB for things like Photoshop, and lots of other stuff.So how does this Hybrid drive do? I was able to copy the old Windows onto the new 750GB hard drive, and got my new computer to boot from it. And the performance is amazing. 8GB of SSD is much closer to the sweet spot, coming in just a few seconds behind what the 120GB all-SSD would manage. My guess is that you may not notice the 500GB drive, but you would definitely notice the 750GB. Although the drive is rated for SATA 6GB, you can use existing SATA 3GB connections at the expense of a small amount of speed.I noticed a lot of people who used Mac laptops reviewing the 500GB hybrid drive. It would appear that the drive will work with a Mac, but part of the SSD area is reserved for particular Windows files. However, Mac users seem impressed with it, in fact the major favorable reviews of this drive on Amazon come from Mac users.So, is it for you? I must mention that right now, a shortage of drives has driven the price up, and I feel that this situation will exist through the summer until production reaches normal levels. In normal times, I would guess that this drive would retail for $150, but even paying the current price, the drive is worth it. All it requires is for you to install the new drive, copy over the old hard drive, and then tell the machine to boot from the Hybrid. If you have a laptop, you may have to do this on your desktop, but once it's done, that's the end of the installation.As someone said, all hard drives should come as Hybrids. Although all-SSD drives will fall in price, that drop in NAND pricing means that Hybrid drives will become cheaper and/or larger in capacity. Anandtech has a very positive review, and a dozen more can be found on Seagate's site.So install it and sit back. You won't be disappointed.EDIT - I hear that a 1TB drive in this series is in the works. No idea when it will be released, or what the price will be, but imagine it with 16GB of SSD.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Seagate is almost there", "unixReviewTime": 1326153600, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2012"}

First the viewfinders resolution Is great and its fast, but the ENORMOUS issue is that there is no  sort of covering around it so you can see on a sunny day. Without using your hand to cover the light around it the viewfinder is useless, and Panasonic does not even offer and sort of rubber eye cup to block out the light. I now know that for the Olympus M4/3 cameras they do offer a cup, but it does not fit this view finder. So I ended up making my own out of an old Cannon eye-cup.  I just shaved off the back and the bottom and squeezed it on, it now works perfect. But I have to say the viewfinder is an eye sore when its attached to a beautiful camera like the GX1. Another issue is that it does not clip down, the  viewfinder opens up to 90 degree position from time to time when I put it in my bag.My conclusion is that if these companies just put a bit more though into this viewfinder it could be more practical, but as of now it will do, I have changed it to my liking and I'm happy with it  but I had to adapt it, it does not come this way out of the box.

The built-in speakers in both devices produce very weak sound even at the maximum setting and cannot be heard well over the music when we are driving. This little speaker totally solved the problem.  The sound is excellent, we have the volume set at about 1/3 level and it is clear, crisp and loud.  It produces no distortions and the sound quality is good not only for voice but for music as well.I am attaching a collage of three photos under customer photos number 1 through 3 that I will be referencing in this review.1. Despite the large sound the speaker is quite small. Photo #2 shows it my hand.2. The speaker has a small loop at the top, which can be used in many ways to hang the speaker in the car: from the mirror, from the GPS mount, or as shown in picture #1 from the hook on the side of the car.  This puts the speaker next to the driver's head and making the sound a bit louder to the person who is driving.Photo #1 shows the loop clearly, photo #2 shows the speaker attached to the hook with two wire ties.3. To pair the speaker with the device you need to turn the speaker on, then scan for blue-tooth devices on the your tablet/phone, when the speaker is found, all you have to do is select it. That's it.Photo #3 shows Nexus 7 navigating while giving us instructions over the DBEST London mini speaker.o4. Works about 20 hours wireless (40 hours when plugged in)5. Comes with a USB cable for recharging, no AC recharging cable. We purchased a USB plug so the speaker can be recharged at home from an AC outlet.Small gotcha:After a stop in driving, even when the speaker is left on, when we resume driving the blue-tooth pairing does not happen automatically. Turning the speaker on and off does not fix the problem.  We need to use to re-scan blue-tooth devices on the Android device to get the speaker connected again. It feels like a problem with the Android OS (running JellyBean OS in our case) rather the speaker.  However, compared to the great sound, no wires, and convenient options for hanging this is a relatively small annoyance.This is the third speaker we auditioned for this job and we finally have a winner!

When I go on vacation, I don't want to carry all my expensive and heavy equipment.  I was looking for something that will allow me to get good vacations shots and not have to worry that there will be a problem with the pictures or the camera.I got this Sony for just that reason and I have put it through the paces to see how it performs.In general I would say it does a fine job.  Pictures are clear and useable for prints and Facebook and the same goes for the videos.I always turn off any digital or software zoom on the camera.  I figure Photoshop and Lightroom can do a better job than the camera's firmware.  With that said, the 30x zoom performs very well.One of the tests I did was to take some pictures of license plates of cars more than 100 feet away with the 30x zoom.  Not only was the license plate numbers clear, I could read the numbers (easily) on the registration stickers.  So while it wasn't as sharp and my expensive lens might have shot, for this kind of camera, I was pretty pleased.The videos were nice and clear and I could not detect and sound from the lens when zooming during the video.  Focus stayed locked on until I had zoomed to 30x on something only a foot away.  But I wouldn't expect to actually have worked.The thing I personally like the most is the live histogram.  You get this by turning on more information as a display option.  I think it actually works better as a light meter indicating what range of values you would get if you shoot the picture. Most cameras will give you a histogram of the shot after you take the photo.This camera has another interesting feature.  Both a view finder and a rear display.  It also senses when you are using the finder and turns off the display as to not draw your focus from the view finder.  This is a nice feature.There are a few things I don't like.  The camera \"feels\" cheap.  It is made of plastic and just feels like it will break if you drop it.  The automatic settings seem to choose high ISO values even in bright light. And one thing this camera doesn't do well is control the amount of noise in high ISO pictures.  However, there is a setting on the camera to reduce noise after taking the shot, but this adds about 2-3 seconds to each picture and unless you are in multi-picture mode, the camera is as slow as most point and shoot cameras.  I also wish there was a raw mode.There are a bazillion photo effects, but I never use any.  If I want to do that, I do it outside the camera.Though auto works okay, I would suggest shooting in P or M mode with the live histogram.  But no matter what mode you shoot in, you can take some very nice pictures and video with this camera.  Just don't drop it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I like this camera", "unixReviewTime": 1338681600, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2012"}

The still photo quality isn't that much improved from the previous HX9V even though the pixel count is now at 18.2MP(as a matter of fact, most of the time, you can hardly see any difference at all, esp. when you print the photos). The video portion (now w/AVCHD 2.0) now has 1080p at 60fps which is very nice and looks amazing on a big HDTV (24p recording is also available). One of the biggest improvements seems to be the increase in zoom range--now at 20X. You can also view 3D images on the lcd screen now (without 3D glasses) which is cool. Build quality seems to have gone down a little bit....when compared to the HX9V....it's lighter and there's no chrome or metal trim...making it look \"cheaper\" and less elegant. However, overall, I'd say this is probably one of the best compact cameras in the market right now.

I have a couple small pocket ones, and aPanasonic Lumix Super-zoom, and have been very happy with all of them.  Pitting them (mostly the higher end, super-zoom Panasonic) against this Sony seemed a little unfair, but I didn't mind the unfairness enough to let it stop me.First of all, the Panasonic has a quality lense that about 4 times the size of this one.  While I'm certainly not an expert in all things camera, I have noticed one thing:  given high quality lenses, the bigger one is usually better at something.  However, this little Sony, smaller, easier to carry around, and much more attractive takes AMAZING pictures, sometimes right on line with the Panasonic, but usually better.  Low-light conditions are equally amazing - no pixelation or blurriness.Another great thing about this little guy is that, from the time you press the power button to the time you press the shutter button, you can do it all in just about 2 seconds (maybe a tiny bit less.)  Granted, that's an unscientific test from me trying it out while watching the second hand tick, but really:  when you press power, the camera is ready to get down to business.However, depending on the picture (and I'm not just talking about the special effects like \"illustration\" that makes things look like comic books or panoramas, but even in Intelligent Auto mode), you might not be able to take rapid-fire pictures.  Case in point:  when shooting in low-light, the auto mode did everything for me and took a great picture, but after taking it (and before showing me what it took), there was \"Processing...\" on the screen for a couple seconds.  Whatever it's doing when processing makes the picture look great, but there is a lag between your next picture possibility.On the same token, while the video also looks great, regardless of battery power remaining or amount of memory remaining, the video is limited to 29 minutes.  While this means that I won't replace myKodak PlaySport (Zx3) HD Waterproof Pocket Video Camera (Black)for use as my dash-mount car-cam, it certainly isn't a deal killer.  Plus, the waterproofing means I can take this Sony anywhere that I'd otherwise have to take a Panasonic (great stills, video, but bulky AND the Kodak (bad stills, good video, waterproof) - overall, a huge win.One comment on the touch-screen:  I had a touch-screen Fuji camera that was a total failure.  The menu's were horrible, the touching barely worked, and the entire thing seemed like a fluke.  This Sony?  The menu's are very intuitive, the touching works *almost* everytime, and now going back to the dial and small arrow keys of the Panasonic seems like I'm going back in time.At the end of the day, this is now my \"default\" camera.  Very few negatives to speak of:  I had to buy a new microSD card, even though I have standard SD cards laying around; the zoom is somewhat difficult to engage because the knobs' position and size; it's one of the coolest looking cameras I've seen, so somebody is probably going to try to steal it; I now feel a little disloyal to Panasonic, after years of a friendly relationship...  but given the quality of Sony, I think I found a new loyalty.Highly recommended.  The photo modes are a novelty (make people look like comic book characters; take black and white pictures, but extract 1 color...black,white,and red, for example; watercolor, etc), but they are tremendously fun and depending on the picture, actually make the photo better than just the norm.**UPDATE, 8/25/2012**Down to 3 stars from 4.  Turns out, the video on this thing is absolutely horrible.  MyKodak PlaySport Waterproof Pocket Video Cameratakes much, MUCH better video.  The biggest problem with the Sony?  If you move, or your subject moves (as in, you know...motion), you get nasty horizontal line shifting in and out all over the place.  There's probably a technical term for it, but all-in-all, it makes the video feature pretty worthless if you want to show it to somebody else.  The second biggest problem with the video on this?  The color saturation.  It's just not there:  the Kodak has it (less than 100 bucks), and the Panasonic has it...this one does not.And now, after extensive usage from it, there are two other major faults, in addition to the video capabilities being horrible.  (1)  The overall quality of the still photos, in many scenarios, is actually far less than the previously mentioned Panasonic.  In some settings (plenty of ambient, but not direct light), it looks on par...in low light, it still does great.  But day to day pictures, Panasonic is far superior when it comes to image quality.  (2)  When I take a picture in \"Intelligent Auto\" mode or the other \"Super Intelligent\" or whatever, after each picture, it sits there with a \"Processing...\" screen.  It takes a LONG time to snap pictures rapidly.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Incredible camera, but not quite perfect", "unixReviewTime": 1337731200, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2012"}

If you are more interested in a lighter camera with a touch screen and willing to compromise on the zoom (5X opposed to 10X in the WX150) and pay up for it (about 100$ more), DSC-TX66 may be a better choice. But if the touchscreen is not a critical requirement for you and zoom is of more importance, WX150 is a very compelling choice at this price-point.

I was at the gym recently and the sound of the earbuds jostling about in my ears was distracting. I don't recall ever having that problem with cheaper earbuds. This sound persisted even after I customized the buds to fit the shape of my ear.On the positive side, the sound is decent though the bass and treble weren't that impressive. Its most effective feature was the noise-cancelling feature, which effectively blocked out any other noise. It worked so well that I would never use these buds while driving, crossing traffic or walking alone home late at night. With the spate of iPhone robberies, it's better to be able to hear a stranger's footsteps behind you. It's perfect, however, when you're on a subway or a bus and you want to block out that annoying person next to you who insists on complaining about her day.The set includes a microphone for your iphone, which I don't use that much but works well enough - I heard my friend's voice on the other end of the line in very crisp, clear tones.What's convenient is that the buds work with even the oldest ipods around. From the classic 2009 model to the most up to date Nano. Sony was smart to do this - that means a lot of people, not just techies with the most up-to-date devices, can use this. As an example, a friend of mine still has a working iPod mini (don't laugh, he's a Luddite!) and we tested the headset on that too. Surprisingly, it worked! - though the volume controls did not work with such an old, outdated model.Another convenience is the location of the controls, which are located on a box located on the cord, which prevents you from having to reach all the way down to your iPod or iPhone to adjust the volume. My second favorite feature is the included clip, which allows me to wind up any slack on the cord and prevent it from getting tangled easily. In the past, I've killed so many earbuds because I pulled too hard on the cord by accident, so this is a welcome feature.This deluxe model includes a pouch that offers an array of different sized earbuds - one set is noise-cancelling, while the other isn't. This is overkill, though. I tried out different sets of buds but none of them fit just right. And the \"thwoping\" sound I mentioned earlier still remained.So I have mixed feelings about this product. The \"thwomping\" (sucking) sound is its biggest drawback for me, as the buds work best when you don't move around a lot.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Revised Review - \"Thwomping\" Sound of Earbuds is Annoying", "unixReviewTime": 1336003200, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2012"}

Previously I have been using my old Rayovac PS3 Universal Smart Battery Charger for charging C and D cells. But the PS3 can only charge up to 3000mAh in each session, whereas my newer batteries (such as theTenergy Centura C Size NiMH Batteries) are rated for 4000mAh or more.Electrically, the TN190 is a very good charger. Here are several aspects I like:- It is a true 'smart' charger in that it monitors the voltage profile of each cell individually, and stops charging as soon as a negative delta-voltage signal is detected. Most other products in this price range (such as theRayovac PS20PL Platinum Universal Battery Charger) are timer-based and can only charge in pairs.- The AC power adapter accepts 100-240V AC worldwide voltage. In contrast, my old Rayovac PS3 charger uses an AC transformer that is heavy, bulky and only works from 110V AC.- The charger itself accepts 12V input. So with the correct CLA (cigarette lighter adapter), it can even be powered from 12V car battery.- The charger has a very nice LCD panel, which shows you the charging status of all batteries at a glance. Of course it is not as informative as the digital display of myLa Crosse BC1000advanced charger, but for the average user it is easier to understand.- The USB output port can supply 5V 500mA to charge an USB device such as cell phone. Beware that this output is only available when NOT charging batteries. As soon as you put a battery in any slot, the USB port turns off. USB power will resume after the battery is fully charged.- The charger is smart enough to detect and reject alkaline batteries. It will also reject old NiMH cells with higher than expected internal resistance.- The charging current is 1.3A for AA, C and D cells. This gives a charge time of about 2 hours for AA, which is a good compromise between shorter charge time and longer battery lifespan. For higher-capacity C and D cells, the charge time increases proportional to the capacity.- For AAA cells the current is 500mA, so the charge time is again around 2 hours.- The DISCHARGE button is useful if you suspect some of your cells are not performing to spec. What it does is to discharge all cells at 400mA down to 0.9V, then recharge everyone back to full. By repeating this operation once or twice, you can usually improve the capacity.Now for the not-so-great part: I found the workmanship of this charger to be quite poor.- The LCD panel on my unit is mounted slightly slanted.- I was having difficulty with one battery holder, which cannot slide completely down to accept D cell. I had to remove the bottom of the case to make sure nothing was jammed inside. It worked fine after that, however.- While I had the case open, I noticed a lot of sloppy soldering job, with solder flux splattered all over the circuit board. I have to clean it up with alcohol, or else the flux will cause corrosion a few years down the road.Bottom Line:The TN190 is versatile and well-designed. Nowadays it is getting more and more difficult to find a smart charger that can handle individual AA cells, left alone one that can also handle high-capacity C and D cells. So despite the sloppy workmanship, I still consider the TN190 to be a very good value.[Update on Dec 15, 2012]I noticed an odd behavior for this charger today. I put in a set ofSanyo eneloop AAcells that were completely drained to nearly 0V (they were left in incandescent flashlight overnight). The charger display shows charging action initially, but then flashes all status bars after a few minutes. When I check the battery voltages with a multimeter (DT830B DMM), they were all around 0.95V! This could be part of the design to 'condition' over-discharged batteries. After I re-inserted the cells, they were then charged up correctly.[Update on Aug 26, 2013]I have tested theChargeIt! Battery Station Proand consider it a better product. It is similar to the TN190 in price, but offers several advantages. Namely:- Able to recharge ordinary alkaline cells- Two high-current USB ports (1A/2A) that do NOT turn off when batteries are inserted- Better workmanship.See my review on it for details.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good electrical design / Sloppy workmanship", "unixReviewTime": 1353542400, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2012"}

I'm in my 50s and I have no problem seeing this device. In bright sunlight, the screen is extremely easy to view!- Battery life is excellent.  I played only 9 holes this evening and when I plugged in the G6 to charge it again when I got home, there was still 80% battery life remaining.- Distance measurements were right on the mark.- The size of the unit. It is small and it fit in my hand perfectly.Cons- Just one so far in only one round of use, but it took quite a while for the satellites to connect. I live fairly close to the course, so I'll just turn on the device at home before I leave and by the time I get to the course, it should be connected. Also, once it did connect, I never lost signal during the round. I recently tried the new Callaway MX+ and it shut off in the middle of the round.  I returned it to Amazon.Overall, the G6 was a pleasure to use.  It responded quickly and the scoring was easy as well.  I didn't read the manual and I was using it like I had it for months!

We've only been using it for a couple of days so far, but no dropping or intermittent connection issues for our 11 devices.  It is not dual-band, which isn't really an issue for us, and it does NOT have IPV6, which some descriptions indicated it did have.  That's not really a problem for most home networks at this point, but it could be a problem in the future if / when we run out of IPV4 addresses for stuff...  At ~$40, it's a solid, reliable option for a basic home router.The caveats:- The 'my dlink' service touted by dlink as a way to (remotely, if you prefer) manage your connections is not very robust.  The options to configure the router are minimal at best; the connections list is extremely slow to respond to requests to refresh it, and the 'blocking' capability requires that you know the MAC addresses of all the devices in your network- which might be easy for some people, but isn't very intuitive.  It identified one of our Android ereaders as a 'suspect' device and recommended blocking it with no other information except a MAC..  It seems to drop some connections from the displayed list of connected devices without explanation or reason, even though I've physically verified the devices are still connected to the network.The 'my dlink' service also allows you to connect remotely using an Android device...which seems to me to be inherently full of security problems that I'd personally prefer to avoid.- The speed of the router is just \"OK\".  It's fine for most networks in a smaller household, but it is nowhere near the specs listed on the box. Several organizations' testing has verified this.- You can't remove the dual antennas and add bigger/better ones to increase the gain; they are large and permanently fixed to the router (whatever happened to those nice 'screw on/off' connections?).Hope that helps!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good basic router with some caveats", "unixReviewTime": 1354924800, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2012"}

It picks up all hand movement on the camera, the zoom button sound, and it also seems to have trouble adjusting between far away and close in sounds.

While the 300 seemed sturdy and solid, the 110 feels cheap and flimsy.

Workflow solutions imply that a photographer has a \"workflow\".  As people idle in their hobbies or progress towards a more professional stance, these types of programs can come in handy... not only to learn what a workflow \"means\" but also how you might progress further than you thought possible.Truthfully, and as a matter of disclosure (and bias), this photographer uses Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X3 (and prior versions) and more recently photoFXlab more than just about any other photo programs.  More on what and why later...This photographer, as with many who take pictures for enjoyment and as a profession, simply wants the camera to be the window you look out of and into. What you see is what you want.  That translation with any given camera, lens set, filters, etc varies significantly. Add in what a person does with basic and more advanced hardware (camera) settings and the number of variables is nearly infinite.  This is difference between photos that are good and those that are great.  In the end, the majority of people want a simple way to quickly remove errors, improve quality, or add a flare of creativity.This is where workflow programs excel.Workflow allows you to do editing in a sequence that often results in the best photo possible.  These same programs have learning curves, especially for those that may not have ever picked up this type of program. In the same way, it is totally unrealistic for a review to provide a comprehensive view of anything more than what a given photographer generally uses on a regular basis.  These programs can be expansive, feature filled, and daunting.What do you normally do with your photos? If you do a single fix and move on, you may have no interest in workflow.  If you do a couple of things with every photo, or have a batch of photos that require the same fixes, \"workflow\" is definitely something you need. In fact, all photographers suffer from the \"whole roll\" ruined by some wrong setting.  The younger crowd probably is wondering what \"whole roll\" means, but that terminology is as fresh for digital as for \"tape that show\" in regards to DVR recordings. It is easy to ruin a batch of photos and workflow can fix that entire batch.AfterShot Pro has a similar feel to Lightroom, along with its similar feature set.  Files to the left, organizer and photos in the middle, and processing to the right.  It is easy to get started and figure out what a feature does, along with interactively making the change and reversing it if necessary.  AfterShot Pro is easy to use.  Lightroom has a more significant learning curve.  Again, you have to ask what you want to do.That same question answers what this reviewer does with photos.  For some, plug-ins is where the magic happens.  Good photos, bad photos... the proper plug-in can make your extensive skill shine, or cover up your lack of skill.  I want to sort through photos quickly and tweak them. That is my workflow. This is my fundamental problem with all paint and/or workflow programs--how many steps does it take?  What plug-ins are loaded in, how tweakable are they, and how accessible are the plug-in you may want to load from third parties? AfterShot (and Lightroom) do not have anything but standard none too exciting plug-ins. That leaves you with how easily you can access third party plug-ins.  AfterShot installs these plug-ins simply and provides them in the far right tab in the main workflow.  Processing speed on normal computers (with a discrete graphics card) is acceptable.  My go-to for tweakable plug-ins at the moment is Topaz Labs. AfterShot does provide an acceptable way to accomplish my workflow.It is obvious that this review is not going to delve into the details, and for the majority looking at this particular program, those details are unnecessary.  There are a lot of programs out there for workflow, general processing, and photo tweaks. People swear by the expensive ones like Lightroom. The major advantage of AfterShot Pro is its price vs feature set.  It is not \"cheap\", but it is very cost effective compared to the alternatives.... and it stands up to a Lightroom comparison.AfterShot is an excellent way for those interested in this type of program to learn more and progress in their craft.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Get your feet wet!", "unixReviewTime": 1343952000, "reviewTime": "08 3, 2012"}

However, in working with Acer Support in trying to resolve a minor problem, I discovered something all potential Acer customers ought to know.Acer has officially announced they will not be upgrading the operating system on A100, A200 & A500 devices beyond Android 4.0.3 - Ice Cream Sandwich. There will be no Jelly Bean - Android 4.1 or Android 4.2 upgrade!The good things about this tablet are:1)Though not the fastest tablet on the market, nor does it have the highest video resolution - considering what I paid for it, (I bought it on sale for $225), it does a great job for the price.2) You can download and install apps from Google Play, the Amazon App Store, as well as other sites. Thus, there are literally thousands of apps in all categories one can utilize.3) The video is more than suffice to watch movies, TV shows, etc from Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, etc. in HD.4) You can connect a keyboard, mouse, or an external speaker via bluetooth.5) You can easily customize it - background photo, and app and widget layout - to your liking.6) This tablet is also good enough is serve as a backup for my desktop.The negatives are:1) No android upgrades will be available for this tablet beyond android version 4.0.3.2) After setting up the tablet to work with my bluetooth keyboard & mouse, now - even with bluetooth turned off - the tablet defaults to the physical keyboard, instead of the built-in one. Thus, after turning on the tablet, I have to manually set it to use the android keyboard.3) At random times and for no apparent reason, the tablet loses it WiFi connection. This can be easily fixed by turning WiFi off and turning it back on and reconnecting to your network. But, at least for me - it does seemed to be an unnecessary hassle that so far, Acer Customer Support has not been able to resolve without me sending them the tablet.4) And lastly - With all tablets running android 4.0.3 and newer, while you can store documents, music, photos, backup of your apps, etc. on an SD card, you cannot move an installed app from main memory to your SD card and run the app. Thus, your main memory is all you have for installing and running apps. This used to be a greatly memory saving feature in Android version 2.3.Considering the fact that most people upgrade whatever tablet they buy to a newer one about every two years anyway, I would recommend the Acer A200.

Tucker \"Looking for the Best\"", "helpful": [134, 141], "reviewText": "As with the other reviewer, I bought mine yesterday at Costco for $179. The costco bundle includes a 4 gig class 6 sd card and a carry case.I have only had a couple of hours with it but I think it is a good value. Depends on what you want it for of course.I changed my old Kodak 850, a similar priced/featured camera because it was giving some issues and the newer cameras offer some terrific technology upgrades. (And I am a Kodak retiree......when I was working Fuji was the enemy!)I specifically wanted a better zoom, with image stabilization. (I have an old man's tremor.) We spend some time in Hawaii during whale season. You really need high zoom if a lot of your whale watching is from shore. We also want Bald Eagle pictures when they land is some trees 200 yds from our house.Another \"nice\" feature for my usage is the option of iso 6400. Also handy is the 1/2000 fastest shutter speed.Several relatives have dslr's but I wanted the zoom without the bulk, and without the expense.I have done some experiments with the 30x zoom. I found I could take sharp daylight pictures at 30x zoom (the equivalent of 500mm focal length) by using the 6400 setting and 1/2000 shutter speed, using shutter priority. I handheld the camera for these. I judged sharpness subjectively on my computer, from the pictures of bare twigs high in trees.The only problem I experienced is that at such high zoom even the slightest movement can take you off your intended subject, same as with a telescope. So in the future I think I will use my walking stick, which has an optional male screw mount and the stick can become a unipod. And of course one can always use a tripod.There is a \"digital\" and \"optical[default]\" zoom selection in the menu. I tried both and the sound seemed similar. I was assuming the digital zoom would lose sharpness in telephoto. It did not seem to do so, as viewed on my computer screen.A feature I like is the fuji-unique \"f\" button. Without going into the menu you can change iso and several other settings, in many of the shooting modes.Some caveats: The largest lens aperture is f3.1 in wide angle and f5.6 in telephoto mode. If you want to take really neat blurred background photos portraits this may not be large enough (to reduce the focus range).another caveat; file size. With my old Kodak I was happy with the 2.1mp (mega pixel)setting. That setting resulted in file sizes in the 3/4 MB range. I have gotten good enlargements up to and sometimes including 8x10 with that mp setting, and that is all I need, so why take up more memory? With the 4500, you only get to choose Large, Medium, and Small for mp settings. On the small settings I am getting file sizes in same 3/4 MB range, maybe slightly larger but certainly under 1 MB.Another caveat: Zoom motor noise in video mode. I like to take a lot of video, editing them into dvds after major family get-togethers. There is some zoom motor noise with the 4500. the good news is that the experiment I did had no voice narration other than my comments. The verbal narrative seems to be much higher level than the motor noise so I do not think this is going to be a significant drawback.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good value at costco", "unixReviewTime": 1331510400, "reviewTime": "03 12, 2012"}

As good as that tv was, I have to say this one blows it away.. I've always loved Samsung tv's an this is my first LG, but I couldn't be more satisfied. For one the features and contrast ratio (6,000,0000:1) are a lot better and more advanced. The different picture and sound features once configurated will bring the best out if this HDTV. I actually have the tv connected to my Directv receiver, Sony 7.1 receiver, and Yamaha speakers. The AV Sync mode the tv offered helped out a whole lot to sync picture with audio, considering I'm using an external audio mode. The only flaw I've noticed is the slight audio/image delay caused by the fact the receiver puts out dolby digital audio and me not having digital optical cables from tv to audio receiver directly. I have digital optical cables from Sony audio receiver to Directv receiver, and from Sony audio receiver to PS3 but not directly to tv. Everything connected via HDMI picture wise, but I am going to have to get digital optical cables so they go directly from tv to Sony audio receiver. I was told this will stop slight audio/picture sync issue.. The passive 3D is pretty badass and a lot more in depth than the 3D I got from my Samsung Plasma with active glasses. Definitely a cinema feel to the 3D. The only flaw once again was the 3D channels on Directv, especifically ESPN 3D, show the audio/picture sync issue I mentioned about earlier because of cable configuration. Smartv apps are cool but I haven't tried them much. I rather watch Netflix directly through my PS3 but Youtube and Skype included in Apps for tv is cool to have. Haven't tried all the apps content but will review when I do. Last thing I'd like to mention is the Trumotion feature this LG HDTV offers. It definitely makes a difference watching Football games (or other sports), Bluray movies, and Pixar/Dreamworks animated films! For that type of viewing leave Picture TruMotion feature at Smooth, clear, or User. You can make your discretion to see which one looks best. For regular HD programming and HBO movies and such leave Trumotion off as having it on gives off a Soap opera/play like look to movies and programs.. By the way this tv is Trumotion at 120HZ and the different Picture Trumotion options show that. The 60Hz you see in the tv info when watching programs is the source of your satellite or cable provider.. Even Blurays come at 24Hz but this Tv does give you Trumotion option features up to 120HZ. Apologize for the long review, but truth is this HDTV is badass and has a lot of features to touch base on for review.Update August 18,2012:As I had figured it would be the case, I was able to completely sync the audio/picture issues perfectly by connecting optical digital cables from the Sony audio receiver to the tv! Even the 3D Directv channels specifically ESPN are synced perfectly. Makes this tv even more enjoyable now.

We ditched the cable and satellite money grabbers a while back and have never looked back.  All our local channels come to us via the free over-the-air (OTA).  And I have to say, the OTA signal is fantastic and the picture quality is just as crisp as what cable was offering.  The best part is, I get to see a touchdown a solid 5 to 10 seconds well ahead of my cable user counterparts as they wait for their signal to be routed to their device.So back to the TV.  Without 3D channels why in the world would I purchase this?  Simple.  The 2D upconvert I saw at the store was awesome and watching 3D movies and as a bonus, I get everything on a 55\" LED 240hz screen that will suck you into whatever you are watching...or playing for that matter.  That's right, I also use this for my Xbox 360 and if you play Gears of War 3 in 3D...you won't ever want to go back to normal gaming.All in all, this set is a huge improvement over my 46\" LCD which was showing no signs of wear after 3 years, but to get this TV, along with a 3D blu-ray player and 12 pairs of glasses...that's right, 12 pairs of glasses for $1500 was a no brainer.  Not to mention my local big box store happened to be running a 3 year no interest financing package on anything over $999 so bingo!Now for the 2D to 3D upconvert.  Here is what I've noticed, it is not the cinematic 3D you get while watching movies or shows that were specifically shot in 3D.  What it does is have the 3D going into the TV (if that makes sense) so the depth is more inward than outward...but still crazy.  I've tried settings inside the TV (as there are many:  3D depth, 3D field) and no setting really gets the picture to jump out at you.  At the most extreme settings, the picture is a little difficult for my eyes and brain to make into one since the double image trick is so far apart.  When you watch a 3D blu-ray, the double image is just barely there to produce the 3D.  How do they do it you ask?  I think I've figured it out.  The TV upconverts every image it sees to 3D.  While in the blu-rays I've seen so far, only certain things are coded 3D for the glasses to work on.  So the TV isn't smart enough (yet) to know when you're watching football, don't code the field, lines in 3D but do code the players so that \"pop out\" effect works.The remote is nothing more than a WII remote from Nintendo for those that are looking for a comparison.  It takes a little getting used to, but once you've found the sweet spot, it's pretty basic.  I love how I can be watching TV and turn on the Xbox, then a popup comes on and says, new video source detected, would you like to switch?  Click yes, and I'm playing the Xbox.I would make this purchase again in a heartbeat.  The fact that it is a smart tv which allows me to surf the web, share music, pictures over my network is also a plus.The best part was with all of the money I've saved not paying Comcast awhile back, that savings unknowingly allowed me to purchase this TV.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Even without cable or satellite, this tv is amazing!", "unixReviewTime": 1348099200, "reviewTime": "09 20, 2012"}

Brilliant!  The idea of being able to view from my computer/smartphone/iPad was appealing since one of these things is usually near.  That means I don't have to carry around a video monitor unit that I have to worry about being charged or losing or whatever.  Plus, it means my husband can spy on the baby from work, too :)The Foscam seemed to have pretty good reviews overall, so we decided to give it a shot.  The price far beats some of the top-rated video baby monitors and offers viewing flexibility that a technologically savvy family can appreciate.Without further adieu, here's my quick break-down:Pros:- Love the ability to view baby from multiple devices.  There are several options for apps on both IOS and Android for viewing on this camera.- Infrared works GREAT.  I can get clear views of my daughter from her nearly-pitch-black bedroom.- Infrared lights are very dim and not too distracting (though I don't have experience with other infrared lights...just saying that they're not super-bright or an issue in a baby's room)- Totally silent adjusting.  Yes, this camera is all ninja when you're panning around the room.  The only times it makes noises is when the infrared goes on/off, it makes a quiet clicking sound.  Otherwise, it's quiet enough to give you the confidence that it will NOT wake a baby when you adjust it.- Wireless feature allows for you to use without being hooked up to a computer--something a regular webcam cannot deliver in this situation.Cons:- Set up (as many have mentioned) can be a PAIN.  If you are not familiar with tinkering with your router settings and all that, I'd say get help from someone who does.  I consider myself to be intermediate with technology, and when following the instruction manual, I got frustrated.  My husband finished the job quickly.  Though, when we got a new internet service provider, he had a more difficult time when a new modem/router came into play and it took him quite a while longer to get that figured out.- It's big and ugly.  I can't lie, it's not the prettiest thing to have in your baby's room and certainly much bulkier and less aesthetically pleasing than a lot of baby video cameras...but you sacrifice beauty for functionality.  You'll soon forget about that when you're giggling at your ridiculous baby's antics in clear view.- I'm not sure why, but we have issues with it regularly resetting.  (You know this because when it resets, it runs through a series of panning around and will finally stop at a pre-designated position which is always pointing away from the baby's crib).  Sometimes this happens multiple times a day, sometimes we go days without it happening.

Still amazed at the sound especially now that I've had a chance to break it in for hundreds of hours.  The new model works perfectly and is not flawed like the first unit that was returned and replaced with another a3.I did add some Audioquest Golden Gate Interconnects this time around and that made just enough improvement to the muddy base (tightened up the bass just enough ) on some recordings to add another half star to the review rating.  If it had more power and more outputs I'd give it a 5 star rating.  I'm sure a more expensive interconnect would tighten up the bass even more on the bad recordings but at least now the muddiness is gone and won't overwhelm the rest of the recording.***ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOWHooked this up to a pair of Mirage OM 10 speakers with AudioQuest Type 4 cable.  CD Player is a Cambridge Audio D300 SE.Replaced the stock tubes out of the box with JAN GE NOS 5670 model.  Later after a burn in period of about 20 hours of operation, I replaced these with the stock tubes.  I observed the following.  Stock tubes have a nice sound but with less enhanced bass and a slightly brighter mid range and highs.  Definitely a bit of improvement over the sound I had previously when using my Cambridge Audio A 300 integrated amp.  Overall a slightly smoother sound with the A3.I noticed a clear improvement though when I used the GE 5670 tubes.  Initially the bass was pretty boomy on some songs but that cleared up after about ten hours of playing music.  The audio had a very mellow sound and the bass was much improved over the stock tubes.  Mid range and highs were smoother and individual instruments were easier to pick out in most songs.  The clarity of the music also improved and previously hidden details with certain instruments started to emerge with these tubes in place.I used a variety of music during the the 20 hour break in period.  Classical was the least improved music over the Cambridge Audio amp.  It became slightly smoother but not overwhelmingly so.  Noticeable improvement was heard to older rock, R&B; and Soul recordings especially those from the 60's and early 70's.  It was a night and day difference.  Bass became much tighter, instruments were more detailed and exhibited certain sounds that previously were muddled or not heard at all.  It was as if the recordings had been remastered or re recorded at a later time in the studio.  I also noticed a great improvement to most Jazz recordings as well.  Used Smooth and Contemporary Jazz recordings from the 70's through the late 90's.  Almost as much improvement as with the older rock recordings but not quite as dramatic.I think I would have seen even more improvement over the older amp if I had a different set of speakers.  I purposely bought the Mirage OM 10's in 1999 because they were well known for having a mellow sound.  They have a 90 db sensitivity which is ample to drive this amp.  My previous speakers were Klipsch Heresy's and I am certain if I still had those, the sonic improvement would have been dramatic to say the least.  They had a harsh sound that resulted in listening fatigue after a couple of hours of use.  But since tube type amps are known for creating a more silky, smooth sound and I did not pair this amp with more harsh sounding speakers I did not see quite as much improvement as might be expected with more traditional box speakers.  I also have a pair of Castle Conway 3 speakers in storage and those being a more traditional box speaker might very well show more improvement to the audio once I can pair them with the A3.  Still, the improvement is noticeable with the OM10's and worth the $199.00 price tag.The negative.  One channel started to cut out on some songs that had heavier bass when I moved the audio playback level to around a quarter length turn on the A3.  I tried swapping cables and also switched the cables to the other channel but to no avail.  Even trying the 1/8\" mini plug did not help.  Audio at a low playing level was fine but at a moderate level the problem started.  Never tried a high volume level.  This was a defective unit that will be returned but I plan to replace it with another A3 and will hope it is free from defects.Overall I am very pleased with the sound and it seems evident you could spend ten times as much money for a solid state amp that still won't offer the same kind of sound that you get from a tube type amp.  Even one that is integrated with a solid state amp like the A3.  If you want a mellow, silky sound to your music then this amp will not disappoint you.  This component offered the biggest improvement the sound of my system since I replaced the Heresy speakers with the OM 10's.  Arguably the improvement created by the A3 even exceeds that level of quality realized with the change in speakers.After I receive the new amp and have a chance to break it in even longer I will follow up this review with another.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A3 Integrated Tube Amp (part two)", "unixReviewTime": 1352332800, "reviewTime": "11 8, 2012"}

No amp review is complete without stating what headphones you listen with.  I use Grado SR80.  These are 32 ohm headphones, which makes them easy to drive with just about any source device.I listened to a variety of mp3 and FLAC music (rock, electronic, acoustic, jazz) through foobar with all effects and EQ turned off.  For comparison, I switched back and forth between the E17 and the default soundcard in a Dell desktop machine.  Oddly enough, the Dell soundcard is my benchmark - in previous comparisons I found no difference at all between the Dell and a Nuforce UDAC-2, and the Dell is much better than a Creative X-Fi USB DAC/amp I bought on the cheap.  Having been unimpressed with other headphone amps I've tried, what I really wanted to get was the highly regarded, open source design Objective Desktop Amp (ODA), but this would have cost nearly three times as much as the E17 and lacks many of the E17's useful features and inputs.Differences in sound between the E17 and the Dell are minimal.  My first impression was that the E17 was a bit warmer and a bit more veiled than the Dell, but more careful volume matching between the two devices eliminated that perceived difference.  After listening to quite a lot of music on both devices, I can't decisively say that I hear any difference between the two.  That's certainly not to say that the E17 isn't good, but unless there are noticeable problems with your current sound setup, the E17 might not make any audible improvement.Nonetheless, I'm planning to keep the E17.  It will replace the inferior Creative X-Fi as my home headphone amp, and I also plan to use its SPDIF inputs to listen to audio from my PS3, DVD player, and CD player.  That kind of versatility is hard to beat at this price.  I also tried connecting it to my Sansa Clip+ player (Sansa headphone out to E17 AUX in) but get no sound at all through the headphones.  I know that this hookup is not ideal because the sound is amplified by both devices, but I'm not sure why there is no sound at all; I might need to test with another device to make sure the AUX input is not defective.As a final note, I'm sure some people will assume my ears just don't work right since I didn't hear differences between the E17 and a stock soundcard.  I don't claim to have golden ears, but I know what well-recorded and well-reproduced music should sound like, and I do my best to eliminate as many sources of bias as possible when listening.  Plenty of research literature exists showing that people are not nearly as sensitive to different audio components as they believe they are, so it's important to take all hype and fawning reviews with a grain of salt.UPDATE: The AUX input does work with my Sansa Clip+ player.  To my surprise, at a given volume on the Clip+, my headphones sound louder directly through the Clip+ than when played via the E17.  In any case, sound quality using the setup is good, but I'll have to do more detailed comparisons to see if there's any sound quality benefit to the Clip+ and E17 combo.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "good sound, great features", "unixReviewTime": 1353283200, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2012"}

To be honest, I was expecting to be disappointed because the 1005HA has been so dependable and functional. But the U32U-ES21 is such an enormous improvement that it is really in a class by itself. I am still getting used to it and especially to Windows 7, but here are my first impressions:- the screen angle issue is real, and obvious when compared to the excellent (matte!) LCD screen in the eeepc, but not a huge problem. Maximum brightness is about the same. The view angle might have to do with the U32U screen being LED-backlit, which probably saves battery drain. The much higher resolution and of course the extra \"real estate\" more than makes up for this, and blacks are richer too.- It's a joy to have the additional keyboard size and especially a more conventional layout of the right side keys. The keys are a bit on the stiff side but I am making far fewer typing mistakes. (The eeepc also had some repeated key problems that I am happy to find absent now). My eeepc had a black-on-white keyboard, which is easier to see in dim light than the new one, but that's only an issue for hunt-and-peck typists in darkened bedrooms, like me.- Fan is much, much quieter and the unit runs cooler than the eeepc!- Windows7 is a great advance over the familiar and reliable but now clunky XP. The 4GB standard RAM seems to handle it fine.- I've had no wi-fi problems at all so far, although I get different strength indications with the 2 laptops side by side.- I have not put them on scales yet, but it is about the same weight as the eeepc with an oversize battery.- Video playback is perfect at full screen, but I have not tried and HD yet.- The Caps Lock and Num Lock lights are very welcome features, avoiding errors and/or the need to install an on-screen program.One star down from perfect because of the stiff keyboard and screen issues, and the truly TERRIBLE Asus website, but really quite an amazing value.  Yes, I have to add that I have never even succeeded in registering my computer, getting access to their cloud storage, or even finding a list of models, on their website. I can only hope that I'll never need any type of real assistance. (Their webpage for driver downloads can't even recognize the model computer - I had to get drivers from other sites!  Boooo ASUS)Six weeks later:  I'm noticing how flexy the keyboard is, but it doesn't matter to me. More worrying is that I had to reinstall the keypad driver a couple of times before I got the 2-finger scrolling feature to work right, and also the default settings have to be changed for it to work right. (Forget about the \"Scrybe\" junk). And if you switch between a mouse and the trackpad you will find a little program called Change Mouse Speed very useful.To compensate for a slowish AMD CPU I installed another 4 Gb of RAM ($25), and disabled most of the Win7 screen animations. Now I am more than satisfied with the snappy performance, including HD videos (I'm not a gamer). I have rigged all my peripherals into a sort of quick docking station when I am not on the road - mouse, backlit keyboard, big monitor, backup HD. I have some issues with how Win7 handles its \"Libraries\", and can't for the life of me understand why ASUS makes the \"OS\" drive partition (C:) the default for data rather than the \"Data\" partition \"D\".Maybe that is why the Mac Airbook is so popular - it's not a do-it-yourself project like ASUS always seems to be.Now if Amazon would only quit changing the price every week it will be a great little laptop for about $400.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Giant step up from eeepc, pretty nice laptop!", "unixReviewTime": 1343347200, "reviewTime": "07 27, 2012"}

One disturbing trend I noticed is that: the speed class rating for micro-SDHC is typically inflated. For example, a 'class-10' rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least 10MB/s. But somehow, a class-10 microSDHC cards is always slower than a class-10 SDHC card from the same manufacturer. Case in point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to be 'class-10', yet it can only write at 8.6MB/s maximum, while the full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisPolaroid 32 GB micro SDHC (P-SDU32G10-EFPOL)did better than the PNY microSDHC. It achieved a sequential write speed of 10.3MB/s in CrystalDiskMark. So strictly speaking, it does qualify as a 'class-10' card. However, a closer look at its random write speed revealed its weakness. For writing small files, this Polaroid class 10 card is actually much slower than theSanDisk class-4 microSDHC SDSDQM-032G. See the benchmark results I uploaded to 'Customer Images' for details.When you use a memory card in a digital camera to record HD video, it needs to store a huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speed is most critical. So you should always choose a class-10 card over a class-4 (assuming both speed ratings are honest, of course).When used in a tablet or a smart phone, however, the card's random write speed for small files is more important. That's why in such applications, theSanDisk class-4 cardwill actually perform faster than thisPolaroid class-10 microSDHC card. The Sandisk card is also priced lower as of this writing.[Other Notes]- Polaroid Corporation went out of business 4 years ago, so I have no idea who actually makes this 'Polaroid' card. The back of the card says \"Made in Korea\".- The size of this '32GB' card is 29.9GB according to my computer. This is actually normal because computer people count one Gig as \"2 to the power 30\", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. So 29.9GB translates to 32 billion bytes, which is '32GB' according to marketing people.[Update on Jan 7, 2013]I have tested theSanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 card(SDSDQUA-032G-U46A), and found it to give faster all-round performance.

{"reviewerID": "A8TDR5HXUNQTX", "asin": "B0072B5DZC", "reviewerName": "Patrick \"PCS\"", "helpful": [12, 12], "reviewText": "First off, I must say this camera's large sensor and full 1080p recording are not understated. This is the same sensor as cameras twice as expensive in the panasonic line, and the quality is superb. Overall I am very happy with this camera, but I will share a few thoughts that might influence your purchase decision:Pros:- Great wide angle zoom range: I almost bought the canon but this went nearly twice as wide allowing you to get close or film indoors and still capture the full scene. Plus, even with the wide angle the long optical zoom range exceeds what you should practically be using anyway as fully zoomed in the camera shake on anything but a solid tripod makes the film nearly unwatchable so this camera truly has an optical zoom range that gets as wide as you could need, and closer than you practically should be using.- Great sensor: the images are recorded at 60 frames a second at full 1080p, eliminating the trailing lines you get on a 1080i camera. Don't expect to be shooting cinema quality footage, but the quality is sufficient that I went out and got a blu-ray burner and blank blu-rays because there was simply so much more detail that this camera captured that I couldn't bear to part with when archiving & presenting it to friends and family.- Off brand batteries: I immediately bought an off brand charger and extra battery for ~1/4 what panasonic sells them for. If you do this with canon or with some other manufactures you will be missing a coded chip and unable to see the battery status (esp. how much recording time is left) but with panasonic there is no such chip so for less than half what a small extra battery would cost I got a large (3hr) extra battery and an off-camera charger. Accessories are one of the major ways a camera gets more expensive (the canon battery/ charger combo is nearly two hundred dollars) so having a cheap alternative (I spent less than forty) is critical component in decision making when are trying to be price conscious.- Simplicity: I handed this camera to my wife with no directions and she started taking footage without issue. The auto-on when you open the LCD and the obviousness (and standardization) of the zoom lever and record button mean that while you have access to more manual features, it is still something you can pass off to an inexperienced person and not be concerned about them getting confused.- Memory card access: I would HIGHLY recommend this camera over one with internal storage. First, the internal storage is only accessible if you remember your cable and plug your camera into your computer, while the memory card can be removed and inserted into a memory card reader present in nearly any computer made in the last 5-10 years. It does mean you need to be sure you have the memory card with you, but it is worth the convenience in my opinion. Furthermore, Memory has dropped below $1/gb so a 64gb card that could hold more video than 2-3 batteries would allow you to take can be had very cheaply and keep you shooting for days.- Compactness: this is a camera that could easily be thrown in a purse, or in my case added to my DSLR camera bag in less space than a single extra lens would have taken. It is not quite pocket-able, but for carrying with other items it is small, light, and easy to fit in a tight space.- Playback: Many camcorders have pathetic speakers for playback. This one is certainly nothing to write home about quality wise, but for total volume during a quick check to see if you got an important moment it is wonderful and far better than I expected.- LCD: Many have suggested you by a lens hood, but I might suggest you hold off on such a decision. I took it out apple picking on a sunny day and put the lens hood on automatically, but when I took it off I still had no issues. If you are headed to the beach or desert or somewhere with a lot of sun and glare I can see it may become an issue, and the lens hood does help with being able to closely track focus, color & framing, but I was actually perfectly contented outside on a sunny day without a lens hood. Having the lens hood in my bag though does give me the safety net of know I will always be able to see my screen in any circumstance.- Auto-closing lens: I will admit my last video camera is ~10 years old, but having a lens cap that closes on its own whenever the camera is turned off is wonderful to protect the lens from dust and scratches, but is never in the way when you want to shoot. Its pretty much par for the course today, but I just had to say I like this feature.Cons:- Audio Quality: I want to play with the settings more, but I was somewhat underwhelmed by the audio quality. To add to my disappointment, the camera has an add-on cold shoe (where you could mount a mic) but it sticks out at the far back of the camera, so any mic mounted to it would hang over your zoom control. Overall, the audio quality is fine for a personal camcorder, but given the spectacular video results I think I set my expectations too high for the audio, and sadly there isn't a convenient way to bring the camera's fair audio quality up to match its superb video quality.- Touch Screen: for 99% of what you do you won't even use the touch screen, but as others have rightly pointed out, it is not a sensitive touch screen at all. It requires a solid push, and for tasks that involve sliding or dragging it frequently mis-interprets your gesture. Ultimately, I don't find myself using the touch screen much so it is livable, but if you plan on digging into the menus for every scene you may want to look elsewhere for a camera with a more responsive screen.Conclusion:This camera takes excellent video, which is ultimately what I bought it to do. Its audio quality leaves a little to be desired, but it does the job and is more a problem of unrealistic expectations than the audio being sub-par for a consumer camcorder. The compatibility with 3rd party batteries makes the camera cheaper to complement with accessories, and the price for a camera with this good (large) of a sensor is truly unbelievable. Finally, the zoom ranges means you won't find yourself too close or far from your subject allowing you to unobtrusively capture the moment. There are a few trade offs in a camera of this price and size, but on a budget this is a wonderful option for capturing important memories.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent video with fair sound", "unixReviewTime": 1349481600, "reviewTime": "10 6, 2012"}

Went to the beach to see how it handled beach and water scenes on different f-stops and different settings on speed preferred, auto, manual, etc.  Went to Atlantic City day and night shots and very impressive especially with a borrowed panny 12-35mm zoom micro 4/3 zoom, which may be a little price at 1,300 but well worth it hooked up with this fine camera.  Price may come down when it becomes more readily avaiable. Tried auto focus and manual focus also.  For a neat little package the camera performed absolutely fantastic, just about as good as my Nikno D700 which totally blew me away - especially weighing in at about 1/6 the weight.  The lens that came with the camera was OK, not great but also not bad for a 14-42mm lens f3.5-5.6.  However a friend who was in Tokyo Japan came back with a Panasonic 12-35mm lens for his Panny camera and let me use the lens for a few days------that is really what blew me away and when it becomes available will be my stay on lens.  The lens is not too big for the OMD but may be too big for the pens and some of the pannys, but not on the OMD.  The photos shot at all different combinations of f stops and speed, as well as ISO performed stunningly.  This combination of camera and lens will be my constant companion, I like it better on the OMD than the primes available through Olympus and Panny and I am a diehard non-zoom lens photog, or was until now.  Not going to go into a complete technical review since that has been hashed over by many on this blog.  If you love your current DSLR, you will be madly in love with this combination of the OMD and the 12-35 panny lens - and you can carry it with you constantly.  Of course the oly primes 24mm and the panny 25mm f1.4 are great primes if you insist as I used to on primes over zooms, both produce excellent results.  This is the first time since I purchased my Contax G2 that I was this impressed with a little camera, granted one is a rangefinder and one is a minature dslr.  I still have the Contax and will probably keep it since it still performs well and I just cannot seem to want to part with it.  Good Luck and Good Shooting.PS...Gave this camera a 5 star would have given it higher if possible, with the panny 12-35 would give both extra star ratings.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "OM-D digital camera", "unixReviewTime": 1342224000, "reviewTime": "07 14, 2012"}

I've had it for about a week and, for the most part, I like it, but it needs a bit of polish.I like that there are 3 different angles at which you can prop your iPad up. I have found a use for each angle, which has enhanced my productivity and enjoyment of the iPad.I like that you can turn the iPad 360 degs. When I first bought it I didn't think I'd use it vertically, but it was only marginally more expensive than the other case I was looking at that only allowed horizontal placement.  I am SO glad that I spent that extra money.  I use it vertically probably 30% of the time, which easily justifies the added expense to me.I like that the iPad clips in securely and the case is substantial enough to give the iPad good protection.I like that there is a stylus holder.I like Targus' customer service (I know, weird, eh?).  Please see below for a bit more on this.And now for the drawbacks...The slots that the iPad rests in are fairly smooth and rounded.  When tapping the screen, especially at the top, the iPad has a tendancy to pop out of the slot and fall flat.  I think this could be resolved rather easily if the slots were a little deeper, or perhaps angled in slighly.The stylus holder is rather small so it's difficult to get the stylus in.  I'm hoping it will loosen up over time.I feel the stylus holder is located in the wrong spot.  I don't always use the stylus and when the case is folded out for use the stylus is on what becomes the bottom.  This causes the case to be tilted back and to wobble slightly.  I think the case would be more functional if the stylus holder was located on the top side of the case or maybe along the edge.The magnetic on/off feature doesn't work particularly well.  Targus is aware of this.  They have offered to send me a replacement case to resolve the issue.  In fact, the customer service regarding this issue was awesome.  I was only on hold for maybe 30 seconds.  The rep was very polite and professional and I had the whole thing squared away within minutes.The iPad is difficult to get out.  I suppose this is a good thing most of the time, but I don't always want the iPad in the case.  It'd be cool if there was a way that you could pop the iPad and the back off at the center ring and then reattach it when you're done.  Obviously, this isn't really an issue, just something I thought would be convenient.Overall, I think this is a good case.  If Targus could iron out a few issues I think it would easily be the best, most versatile one out there.UPDATE:I got the new case from Targus about 4 days ago.  They said it was going to take 6-8 weeks but it only took 2.  Not badThe new case is much better than the old case.  It closes completely so it lays flat and the magnetic on/off feature now works.  Also, the lining is not quite as slippery as the old lining and the notches are more square.  This allows the iPad to remain in the notches more effectively.I still don't like the placement of the stylus holder, nor does it work very well.  I haven't been able to find a stylus that fits in it.  That's the only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Start", "unixReviewTime": 1335139200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2012"}

So if I'm going to invest in a case, it better do more than simply protect the device. The Marware Vibe is a basic case with a few handy features.I plucked it off the Vine first and foremost because of its ability to act as a bookstand. The cover articulation is simple and it works, but is designed for `landscape' orientation. The case is generally unsuitable for standing the Fire in `portrait', but it will work in a pinch if you really need to view something in that mode. I find the former handy for browsing the net while playing a game or writing a paper. I can also use the stood-up Fire to type notes with a stylus while reviewing a game or a movie. However, take care not to tap the touch screen too hard because it causes the cover to bend. Over time, I imagine the folds of the cover will weaken; however, it is shaped so that the bottom of the Kindle touches the non-skid pad on the inside cover to help keep it in place.That non-skid pad is also handy for placing things. I've got thick, manly fingers so hitting buttons on my Fire can sometimes be a mashfest. TheAmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devicesis a good supplement and it sticks to the pad well enough. I can tilt at about 30 degrees before the weight starts to slip it down. Dirt and dust also sticks to the pad very well, so keep that in mind.The trim size of the case suits the device. It doesn't overlap, which also means there no handy place to tuck a stylus or a pen--even the spine is too tight. I was able to tuck the encased Kindle into my Levi's denim jacket inside pockets, and walk around listening to music. Completely filling my pocket, the assembly didn't bulge, though it was still noticeable if the jacket was being bent or blown.Inside the case, the four point attachment harness is a cheap plastic and it gets the job done. Shaped like a letter \"H\" it Holds the unit steady and the four clip points are easy to snap on and off. The elastic band is tight enough to keep the case closed, but like all such bands I've encountered on consumer products, looks and feels like it will hyperextend after a couple years.The Vibe is one of several Marware cases for the Kindle Fire, retailing at about 25 bucks. While there is no pocket or clip for a stylus, and no zipper or magnetic latch, you could do a lot worse for your five-and-twenty payment.

At the same time I ordered a case for it also made by Marware, called the MacroShell Folio. See it at the link below:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HSG3TC/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00It was the lightest in weight at the time, and was offered in a charcoal gray color. The case looks great, and I've liked it, as it hasn't added to the weight and has kept my Fire protected. I don't have a scratch on it and don't have a film over the screen. This one is light too, just slightly heavier than the MacroShell Folio, but the material looks like vinyl, whereas the MacroShell-Folio has a nice sleek look, that never buckles. It looks great. They both hold the Fire in place with the brackets provided and both have a strap.The biggest advantage in this \"Vibe\" version over the MacroShell-Folio is the stand feature. This one stays in place so well. The original one I got, (the MS-Folio) stand is supported only by a groove in which the flap fits to support the stand. It often times slips out of that groove. This Vibe just folds into place and stays put. If you're reading in bed like I do, this is a good feature. You can set it on a pillow in front of you, and it's quite sturdy and handy. All you have to do is tap the right side to turn the page.  The M-Shell Folio needs a flat surface like a table to keep it from moving so it will stay in the groove that supports the stand. If I'm reading in bed I can't put it on my lap or pillow.  I have to hold it in my hand like a book.  If I nod off, which is pretty likely, I read so late at night, I could drop it.  This model is better for reading in bed, or anywhere you need for it to stay in the upright position.So, these are the positives for this one:1) The Stand2) Color: this one is red and easy to spot in a bag or car.3) The price is good on either one. As of this writing they are similarly priced.The negative is that it looks like vinyl, not like real leather. The red is a bit bright too, I would prefer a darker red. My thanks to Amazon's Vine Program for the opportunity to preview this case. I think I will end up using this one more. I haven't taken it off since I got it a few weeks ago.PS: I also love, love, my Fire.

The idea of keeping a screen clean and free from fingerprints is good, but getting one to fit, then figuring out how to keep the bubbles out can be an exercise in complete frustration.TheMoshi iVisor AG Anti-Glare Screen Protection for Kindle Fireclaimed to offer a bubble free installation, but I had a high level of skepticism when I read the claims. However it was worth a try, and here are my subjective results.Likes:+ Good glare reduction in sunlight and bright overhead illumination+ Excellent fit; 7.2\" x 4.4\", no cutting or fiddling right out of the package+ Truly bubble-free; easy and fast installation+ Does not interfere with stylus use; smooth on the screen+ Fingerprints are eliminated; no more screen smudges+ Good \"feel' on the screen; responds well to the touch+ Excellent instructions on the package; easy to follow+ No effect on color balanceMixed:* Price is high, but better in the long run than disposable protectorsDislikes:- Some very fine details are lost in images & print due to matte screenSetup:The Moshi iVisor AG Anti-Glare screen protector come packaged in an easy to open envelope. The four steps for installation are printed in English and other languages on the back of the envelope. Following the directions, this can be installed within 60 second including cleaning the Kindle screen.In Use:This was picked up here to be used with my 1st generationKindle Fire, and do note that it's not designed to fit the newer HD models. As much as I like the original screen and it's accurate rendering of details and colors, there are times that when handing this device to friends and clients, I get it handed back with fingerprints and smudges all over the screen. This has an effect on what one can clearly see on the screen, so it becomes a maintenance issue.One of the things that I wondered was if the screen protector would interfere with stylus use, and found that theamPen New Hybrid Stylushad no problems at all on the surface. It didn't interfere with theMarware Vibe Cover, and I didn't have to remove it for installation.The Moshi iVisor AG is effective as an anti-glare screen protector in bright sunlight and heavy overhead light that we encounter in convention centers and such. It offers additional protection to the screen surface of the Kindle Fire, reducing fingerprint smudges and the potential from scratches. On the downside, there is a moderate reduction in screen clarity in fine details found in photos, and because of its matte surface this can almost be expected. It looks frosted when held up to light prior to installation, but it's far better once installed.Summary:This skeptic was impressed with thisMoshi iVisor AG Anti-Glare Screen Protectorfor the Kindle Fire, and it does live up to its claim for a bubble-free installation. It does an excellent job protecting the screen from smudges & fingerprints, and a good job on reducing glare. It's downside is that very tiny details can be lost in images and such, but that's not as bad as it might sound, as it is acceptable. In its favor, image color is not altered at all, which was good to find. This screen protector is the best I've found yet, and other than the softening of tiny image details, it's recommended for overall screen protection and glare reduction.10/22/2012", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Moshi iVisor AG Screen Protector: A skeptic's experience", "unixReviewTime": 1350864000, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2012"}

This is the first one that (so far, at least--I've been using it for just a few weeks) meets all my requirements, the most important of which is that I an unaware of it. Other protectors change the viewing experience, mainly by adding a murky layer or shiny distortion. This one does make the background to the text a little more like matte paper than glossy but I did not find this a problem.Basically, all these screens are just an enhanced piece of Saran Wrap or acetate that you stick on. It seems so simple. But, too often, like Saran Wrap, it tenaciously produces bubbles, is hard to position, and requires a very careful placing, smoothing and pressure to make it fit. This iVisor protector positions very simply and firmly on the Fire.The purpose of a screen protector is to protect the screen. Again, so simple a notion, but protection should not mean making the display harder to read or turning it into a thumbprint trap or smudge enhancer. I use my Fire very heavily and it is always in my briefcase, on my lap/desk/table and I don't treat it tenderly. What I most like about the iVisor is that it is almost literally invisible. It doesn't indicate its presence through distortions that remind you it's there. The frame fits absolutely perfectly to become an integral part of the Fire. It remains clear and tightly fitting and needs no attention from me.OK, so it's not life-style changing and is just a transparent rectangle that does nothing in and of itself. But it's a little like anti-virus software on your laptop -- you have to have it as a basic necessity. It's just a utility. Heavy Fire usage needs a screen utility.

It is made mainly for transportation and storage purposes, as well as to prevent it from being scratched.Only drawback: if you use a longer USB cable, since the one supplied with the tablet is pretty short, it may be too large to fit in the loop of the cover.Other than that, this is a nicely designed and constructed, and well thought-out product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "snug as a bug in a rug", "unixReviewTime": 1338336000, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2012"}

The stock fan in my HTPC wasn't too quiet to begin with, but had gotten increasingly whiny over time. I really wanted:1) A way to keep the CPU cool2) A low profile cooler that would fit into my Silverstone GD05B case3) Most importantly - a fan that was as close to silent as could be, without spending big bucks on liquid coolingYou can tell that this company takes pride in their product. The first thing that struck me was the packaging. The design and layout of how this product was packaged told me a lot about how effective it was going to be. From the flip out box to the color instructions, this company put as much thought into packaging as they did into the product.This fan fit my needs, and then some. First, please know that I do not overclock or do gaming on this PC, so I can't comment on how effective it would be for that type of use. I use it strictly as an HTPC to record and watch TV, stream netflix/Hulu, and convert recorded tv to a more manageable format (this is CPU intensive). For this application, my stock cooler would keep the temp at around 60C. I installed this cooler, and the temp has not gone above 40C since. Temp aside, the most important factor for me was noise level. YOU CAN NOT HEAR THIS FAN AT ALL. I put my head directly next to it to see if it was on. At about 3-4 inches a way, you can only hear it if you really concentrate and listen. Zero noise from across the room.Installation -Installation was a little tricky. You will most likely need to remove the MB to secure the brackets to the backplate if you have an AMD chip, as I do. I used Artic Silver 5 compound, as I have had really good results in the past with it. Couple of notes about installation:1) Make sure you connect the MB connections prior to placing/securing this cooler. Some of the connections (CPU fan and 4 pin MB power) would not have been inaccessible after installation. Plan accordingly.2) Once you place the cooler onto the CPU, you secure it to the brackets with two screws. To access these screws, the screw driver is actually threaded through the heatsink fins (there are 2 square holes on top of heatsink). This is incredible engineering, but it felt a little dangerous, as you could not see exactly where the screwdriver was going. Just take your time with it, and it will work out.3) I used the low noise adapter. I did not test the installation without it, so I am not sure how much impact this had on the noise level. If you want a silent implementation, I would recommend using it. It does not appear to impact cooling performance, and in this configuration, was dead silent.4) I used the 1 fan configuration. This provided all the cooling I needed, so I didn't even try it with the 2nd fan.Couple of pros/cons:Pros:1) Incredibly engineered - Does what it is supposed to - keeps everything very cool, and you cannot hear it2)Packaging, at least to me, justified the higher cost.3) With the 6 year warranty, you can tell that this company stands behind their product.Cons:1) If I had to list one, the only con I would say is that it is pricey. For me, the price for blissful silence is worth it, so not really a con for me.If you are looking for a completely silent CPU fan for you HTPC, I have no hesitation recommending this product.

It's new generation in many ways: first of all, it's much smaller than other \"portable\" projectors.  It actually fits in one hand and is very lightweight.  Yet it's just as powerful, even more powerful than previous market standards.  It uses an LED rather than halogen bulb, so it's cheaper to run, less delicate, and much less likely to need an expensive bulb replacement.  You can also connect it to wireless devices like iPads or phones with a wireless adaptor (not included).  On the top of the device, you'll find standard focus and adjustment controls to compensate for keystoning effects.  And there is a small foot on the bottom for raising the front of the projector. On the back there are numerous connection sockets: VGA, miniUSB, HDMI, or video/sound, and you'll find cables for each of these included in the box.  There is also a slot for a micro SD chip (not included), allowing you to use the projector all by itself. The only documentation in the box is a small easy-start card.  Most surprisingly, you don't need much more to get going--the projector actually works right out of the box.  Just plug it in and there's your image on the screen!I've been using an Epson projector for about 10 years.  It was a good projector that gave me few issues.  But after using this new 3M projector, I don't think I'll ever go back.  My old projector produced a good image, but this new one is much, much clearer. The 3M projector is fitted for a tripod connection on the bottom.  A tripod makes a much more convenient and adjustable projecting surface than a table--it's lightweight, easily movable, and you can carry it with you rather than searching for a suitable table or cart at your venue and clearing it off.  With the 3M projector on a tripod, I can easily get the projector to exactly the right height to fit the image on the screen.  The size and weight of the projector make it incredibly easy to carry around.  When I took my old projector on the road, I had to carry it in a separate bag that was as big as a large laptop bag.  The carrying case for this device (included) is about the size of a thick portfolio or book.  It fits easily inside a briefcase, backpack, or other luggage.Some reviewers have noted that the internal speakers of this projector are less than adequate.  While the speakers don't provide much volume or quality, they are, at least, present.  If you're going to do a presentation or show a movie, you'd always want larger, more powerful external speakers anyway.  Here, the speakers are provided just for the sake of convenience since devices like DVD players usually don't have any speakers at all.  So if you're trying to watch a movie just with a DVD player and this projector, at least you'll have some sound.Overall, this is an amazing little projector: simple to set up and use, versatile in its connection possibilities, convenient to carry around, all while producing a sharp, bright image.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wow!", "unixReviewTime": 1344988800, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2012"}

they're all cheap, plastic, and basic. that's what you get with a free remote nowadays. at least this one takes AAA batteries instead of buttons. the real question is: does it give you access to all the functions in the tv? the answer is yes. if you're concerned about controlling all your devices with one remote, get a harmony.also, the glass base stand. i never used it, as the tv went right onto the wall, but the base appears to be very sturdy. i'm sure it would be more than adequate to hold this relatively light tv securely on a sturdy surface.the ac cord is hard-wired into the tv and cannot be removed, which i was not entirely happy about, but oh well.there's also just a tiny bit of light that leaks out through a bottom vent on the tv and onto the wall behind it. i've only noticed it once, when i had all the lights off in the room with the tv turned on, and only when the giant tv wasn't blowing my mind with stunning video. it's not a bother to me, but it could easily be fixed with a bit of black electrical tape.i already have an older surround sound stereo system that i hooked the tv up to right away, so i can't comment on the sound quality too much. i did test the built-in speakers out to make sure they worked, and they were the typical-sounding flat panel speakers: tinny, thin, and weak. no surprise there.to anyone scared by the brand name on this tv, i can't convince you that your tcl won't fail after a few months. you will have to rely on the reviews of others who have had it longer than myself, and the provided 2-yr warranty. if it does fail, i will update this review accordingly.i bought this tv for $479. i also signed up for the amazon rewards visa, which included a $50 credit. that $50 covered the mounting bracket, low-voltage wall plates for running a/v cables behind the wall, and a recessed wall receptacle to power the tv without showing any cords. i'm tech- and construction-savvy enough to install the whole setup comfortably by myself. in the end, i walked away with a professional-looking install on a tv that looks like it could have cost well over $1000, all for less than 500 bucks.tl;dr-if you're even halfways considering getting this tv, do yourself a favor and just buy it. after a year of searching, i don't think i could have done any better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WOW! that's it.

Of those 4 options - this is my least favorite.  But let me start with the pros.Pros:1.  Easy to pop the iPad onto the 4 rubber corners that hold it into the folio.2.  There is a light elastic strap to actually hold the folio closed.  This is a unique feature and I like it!3.  Automatically shuts off iPad when folio is closed.  This is actually a basic feature that I think every folio should have otherwise it's an automatic FAIL.4.  You can fold the lid into a triangle to use as a landscape oriented base.5.  Nice colors6.  Nice suede-like, soft feelCons:1.  Has a cheap feel to it.2.  Has these strange stains in the interior that I have no idea where they are coming from.  Another reviewer speculates that it may be the glue staining it from the inside and I would have to agree.  I don't even like this folio so I haven't used it or touched it in weeks.  I went to look at it again now to write up my review and there are all these stains on the inside of it.  Now the Targus Slim Case that I actually like and have been using every day for months now is still looking like new.  So I'm really not happy with this folio.3.  It just doesn't feel all that secure or protective.4.  No stand for portrait oriention, only landscape.5.  The elastic band that holds the case shut is a nice and unique feature, the band feels cheap and feels like the elastic will lose it's shape and stretch out quickly.6.  Even with the elastic band, the lid does move around a bit.Bottom line - this would be a nice gift for that co-worker that you see and work with every day, but you don't like that much.  The concept of this folio is greater than the reality of it.  The Targus Slim Case is so much better and yet it's still the same basic design.  It's all in the details.  If I had only this folio with nothing to compare against, I would probably like it a lot more.  But since I DO have others to compare against - it doesn't stack up all that high.  It's basic and just feels a little on the cheep side.  Definitely nothing to brag about.

These are products that have lived up to their reputation.This newLensPen MiniPro Lens Cleaner NMP-1was designed for compact digital cameras and to fit into smaller camera bags. It's one of those rare products that lives up to the \"new & improved\" note that appears on the upper right portion of the package. This MiniPro has a fully retractable fine brush and a flexible chamois tip that uses a proprietary carbon-based cleaning compound that won't spill or dry out.Likes:+ Small carbon tip cleans the lens in ten seconds; fits where larger cleaners don't+ Compact, tight design; fits into the camera bag or pocket easily+ Lens is cleaned without fluids; fingerprints and dust are gone+ Screw-on cap protects carbon cleaner; won't fall off in the pocket+ Retractable dust removal brush; very handy and protects the brush+ Good price on an excellent product; very competitiveDislikes:- None so farIn Use:The new LensPen MiniPro Lens Cleaner was specially designed for compact digital cameras. Think of it as the smaller sibling of my old favoriteNikon 7072 Lens Pen Cleaning System, which is also made by LensPen... check the cap. If you have a DSLR, you want theLensPen NLP-1or the Nikon Lens Pen, as both of these have a larger carbon cleaning pad.The retractable dust removal brush does an excellent job of eliminating general dust and the environmental residue that we seem to collect when we're out taking photos. But where this LensPen stands out is its use of the dry-carbon cleaning pad on the other end of this product. When I was a kid, we used to clean windows and mirrors with crumpled newspaper. Black printing is made with a carbon compound, and the carbon molecules have the capability of absorbing oils, grease and contaminants. It's the carbon that does the cleaning, and why the dry cleaning of this improved LensPen works as well as it does.It was easier to clean the lens of myNikon P7100with the MiniPro Lens Cleaner than with the larger versions as the tip is designed for smaller lens surfaces. Ever have a youngster touch the front lens on your camera with sticky fingers and ask, \"What's that?\" or hand your camera to someone who wants you in the photo, only to get it back moments later with fingerprints and smears on the lens? With this LensPen MiniPro, all you do is dust off any residue with the brush, then remove the screw-on cap on the other end and gently swirl the carbon pad over the lens surface. Within seconds stubborn fingerprints are gone; your lens is clean. It's that simple, and no liquid cleaners are needed.Summary:The newLensPen MiniPro Lens Cleaner NMP-1is fairly inexpensive, and this with the other LensPen products are a very cost efficient way of maintaining your photo gear. It's new compact size and features are evolutionary of a well-designed product in the first place, and it fits quite easily into your pocket or even into the smallest camera bags. It would make a great gift for a photographer who has a smaller camera, and is usually quite appreciated.

Being a lover of all things Sony, I was excited to be offered this Alpha A57 to review.  After two months of playing with it almost daily, I think I can now do a fairly good job of it.What's in the box?You get the camera, body cap, 18-55mm kit lens, strap, battery & charger and a usb cable.  It would have been nice to include a rear lens cap for the lens, but those are cheap enough I picked a few up elsewhere.  You will also need to provide the SDHC card.Stills:This camera takes awesome, clear, sharp and beautiful stills at 16.1 MP.  The shutter speed is fast, press the button and your picture is captured.  The A57 takes pictures as fast as you can press the button.  Auto-focus mode takes all the guesswork out of shots.  Just point and shoot.Manual focus lets you, the photographer set everything from aperture priority to shutter speed, which is perfect when swapping the lens to a manual focus Alpha lens.You can add various effects by simply changing the option wheel on the left side of the camera.  Here you can select portrait, sunset or black and white mode among others.There are still many options this camera offers that I have not and may never try out as they either don't appeal to me as a photographer or I don't see the need.Video:Shooting in full HD, video from this camera comes out just as stunning as still pictures.  You can choose to shoot at 60p fps or go for the cinematic 24p.  Either way, you can easily create video that rivals more expensive professional cameras.And you can do all this with just the kit lens included in the package.  But for more fun, I invested in a 70 - 210 mm and a 500mm lens.  These two lens give me even more versatility than I've ever had before in a camera.  Want a beautiful moon shot?

I consider the iPad as a multipurpose tool. Thus, I have subjected my iPad, and this cover, to a number of professions and hobbies.  Some as low-impact as reading books, to use in a garage or while on construction jobs.  Before the Otter Box, and the protection it offers, my iPad had a very limited use.  Never before had I owned a device which was both beautifully designed, fragile, with so many possibilities as a daily aid.  This cover is the bomb! While taking some of the beauty away from the iPad, it certainly made up for it by opening up so many care-free features.  Now, I have no fear bumping, dropping (low-altitude), or using the iPad in nearly any hostile environment.  The silicone backing is a real device-saver.  It easily absorbs most any abuse I can dish out.  I certainly do not want to convey the thought that i abuse the device or condone such treatment.  all i am professing is that whether you are a delivery person, auto mechanic, or construction worker, this case will definitely protect your investment.As with some reviewers, I am not to thrilled with the screen protector.  While adding a great deal of protection to the iPad, it can be improved upon.  It can scratch with abuse.  however, the slight beauty it takes away from the new retina display is far exceeded by it's durability and worry-free use.  Unless you are using the iPad as an artist, or professional photographer, you'll not be dissatisfied with the screen protector.Other than this slight flaw (of which is no concern to me-but added for others), I wish I can give the Otter Box ten stars!  This should be a no brainier for anyone who plans to use the iPad as a tool, in other than in-house use, and is serious about protecting his/her investment.**Update: 26 Aug 2012 **Well, as previously stated, the only part of this product which may need some work is the screen cover.  After a few months of \"brutal\" use, I decided to see whether I could remove the Otter-box plastic cover and new install a new cover to the iPad.Once I removed the iPad from the case, the plastic screen, which came with the Otter-box, can easily be removed.  Gently, press on one of the from corners until the plastic begins to separate.  Then, continue to work around the cover until fully removed.I feel the ArmorSuit MilitaryShield is perhaps the best cover for the Retina display on the new iPad.  Easily installed (bubble-free, might I add), this cover allows the full Retina beauty to sine through.  Very durable, and resistant to fingerprints, this cover is the clear winner.

Product was shipped same day and arrived 2 business days later with regular shipping.  At first, I have to admit I was a little skeptical of the vegan leather, but after using it for a few hours any questions about the durability faded.  As a case, I find it perfect for carrying from room to room, slim and you're able to hold it in one hand like a loaf of bread.  I haven't used it in this manner yet but it seems very suitable for stashing in a knapsack for travel.  Because it doesn't completely cover the iPad it can't be used in rain and it doesn't haven't any handles or straps for carrying.As a stand, the design allows it to slide effortlessly, in either horizontal or vertical mode. The iPad slides snugly into a plastic portion and can be detached fairly easily though. None of the buttons or openings on the front or the sides such as power or volume are covered or are hard to get to.In its primary stand mode, it allows for two angles via ridges on the bottom.  This is the only weakness IMO - ideally 2 extra ridges would've allowed for greater flexibility for those times you want a steeper angle for reading or a very decreased angle for typing.  However, this is mostly mitigated by the fact you can fold the case over so it can be a stand whose angle you can choose at your leisure.  For those like me who use your iPad mostly on your bed, sofa or on your chest, this is ideal.  If you use it on your desk or table, this second stand option might be less ideal as the stand has less traction on lacquered surfaces.A few weeks after I purchased this item, the stand started sliding down, sometimes with minimal pressure, when inserted into either of the two ridges.  A few days after I received the item, Devicewear sent me an email that politely asked how I find the product and to contact them should any trouble arise.  I bring this up because 1) it shows their confidence in their product as well as commitment to customer satisfaction and 2) after having so many negative customer service experiences over the years the last thing I wanted was to argue or wait on the phone or even by email, and my first instinct was to look online for replacement cases/stands.

When the sun hit it the glare can completely wash out the screen and I can't see a thing so much so that I considered returning the GPS and buying a model with a different type of screen. Since as I said the screen is glass I also needed to protect it from any scratches.  The only thing that will accomplish both of these goals is a screen protector. This is not the first screen protector I have used and I didn't have good luck with the others but based on the reviews I had read I decided to give this brand a try before I returned the GPS.  The shipping costs are a little less if you order directly from the manufacture site. The confusing thing was in ordering it gave me the option for glare reduction  protector and crystal view. I don't know if they have different protectors but I selected glare reduction.In the package they send they also include two rubber covers for your fingers. I just used a pair of disposable latex gloves so that I would not smudge the face of the GPS when applying the cover. Others had said it didn't cover the face of the Garmin but I didn't find that to be a problem.  As with any of these screen protectors applying it without any air bubbles is a major task I was successful in getting most of them out but there are still a few on the edges and I know over time dust will get in those areas and I will have to replace the protector (that is why you should buy 2).Does it work?I have found that it does cut down on the glare from the sun.  The 3590 has a very crisp screen since it is made out of glass and the protector does cut down on the crispness of the screen but I am willing to make that tradeoff. Another Important part of these screen protectors is that they do not interfere with touch screen operation of the GPS unit. With screen protectors I had used in the past after applying them to the face of the GPS they did seem to impede the responsiveness of the touch screen function. So much so that I removed them and threw them away. So far I have not found that to be the case for this protector. Touch screen operation seems to work normally.Would I buy again?Definitely (and probably will since I only ordered one to test it out) .

The materials are cheap, the construction is cheap, the feel of the controls are cheap and it's low end in a world of high tech. I live a half hour from town and pick up very little of the AM/FM stations and NOAA is barely audible with sunny skies so I really doubt it'll work during a storm when I need it. Fully extending the antenna did nothing to help. The station controls are mushy and lack any smooth dialing. The flashlight has three LED lights which are extremely weak which may be good if you're under a house destroyed by a tornado but not so good if you have to walk through miles of woods at night to get help. All external parts are plastic - even the crank. In my testing I found the solar power to be very poor. I placed the unit out in direct bright sunlight for half the day but received less then five minutes of radio time when turned on. The instructions say I should get around 3 hours of play out of 10-12 hours of solar charging.The crank is not hard to turn and works well. The instructions say five minutes of cranking will get you 10 minutes of low volume play. My tests show five minutes of cranking will give you hand cramps and about five minutes of play time. In an emergency that is fine but my concern is will this unit work when you need it three years from now. I've owned nice crank flashlights that didn't work after sitting for more then a year without use.Why are batteries not an option? Would that have been to hard to add? With battery technology today one could get hours of play time from a radio. However the radio does come with a headphone jack in case you want to listen to NOAA Radio in private.I do not have a smart phone that I can test the charger on.

Of course you'll have to catch your breath first.Overall I do not feel comfortable keeping this radio as my sole emergency unit.

Each mode has its own color light but which is which is not mentioned on the headphones themselves so you need to remember.  Also comparison between modes is difficult because of the lag in change and the fact that noise cancellation turns off completely for a couple of seconds when you switch.  If the switching between modes was instantaneous and without turning off it would make the headphones much better.Another down side for travelers is that for some reason the case has become noticeably fatter.  Where the old case slimmed down a bit where the headband portion of the headphones was stored, the new case does not and instead has about a 3/4 inch shelf for the band to rest on and a commensurate increase in case size.  The headphones themselves are a bit bigger also so the rest of the case is also fatter. This is a definite negative for frequent travelers.Another negative I have found it a humming feedback when I use on the highest level with my notebook computer.

In one direction it works of course and one it doesn't.  The other problem is that the connection hides under a little bendable rubber piece and my USB ports are recessed, so I couldn't bend the rubber enough to easily insert it.

The iPad is a quality device, but the Note just does so much more; it's in a completely different league. If you're looking for something iPad-like, look elsewhere. The Note is much more than an app tray.It's not just the S-Pen either. It's the split-screen multitasking, the customization, 2mp front camera (iPad is VGA), quad core processor, removable/expandable memory card slot, full flash browser, live widgets. Then there's the floating video option which floats a video so you can 'watch' whilst multitasking. iPad 3 has none of this.The S-Pen is so exacting, making the Note ideal for editors, students, artists & business folks. If you just hover the pen over an email or movie, a preview will pop up. Most laptops don't have these goodies.To be fair, the iPad has nicer hardware and a higher pixel density screen. iTunes is far superior to Google Music, however, iTunes is quite limiting. The Note allows me to download free music from 4shared or beemp3 & send it w/o having to purchase it. There's a torrent app called aDownloader which can download free movies because Android isn't as locked-down as iOS. The iPad is a quality tablet, but, like the iPhone, it's just an app tray.I would recommend the iPad for kids or older folks who want something simple & don't need all of Note's goodies. For those who just want to surf the net, send emails, watch movies & play with apps, the iPhone is much more simple and direct. Grandma could pick up an iPad & start using it. That's precisely Apple's charm.

The SGN 10.1 is my second tablet, the first being the original Kindle Fire. Sorry Amazon, I really enjoyed my Fire, but there were too many \"cons\" on my list to consider purchasing the new Kindle Fire HD.When researching my new tablet, I looked at all available options.  I decided I really did want the larger screen, so it boiled down to choosing the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 or SGN 10.1.  What really sold me on the Note was the hardware: 1.4 GHz QUAD-core processor and 2GB of RAM. I have a need for speed and thought the additional expense would be worth it. I wasn't really concerned with the S Pen at all, but now that I've had a chance to play with it, I can see how I will use it frequently. The micro-SD expansion slot and volume control buttons were also very important to me. And, I am looking forward to taking my first road trip and using the GPS.This tablet is super fast. Several pre-loaded apps have the ability to multi-task and the tablet doesn't slow down when doing so. Wi-fi is incredibly strong in areas of my home where other devices have weak signals. There's a great selection of apps optimized for tablets from Google Play, Amazon App Store, and Samsung Apps. The front 5MP camera (with LED flash!) takes decent photos and videos, especially for social networking apps like Instagram & Twitter. I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet. The Peer IR remote easily synced with my Sony TV and Brighthouse cable box. I have read other reviews of people complaining about the screen resolution. I really don't understand.  The screen is bright and the colors are vibrant. Pictures and videos are stunning. And from what I understand, the lower (comparatively speaking) resolution helps save battery consumption.The only disappointment I have so far is the proprietary charge/data cable.

It's a tripod, a monopod, a min-tripod, and even more.  However, in execution, it's just not ready, yet.Premise:  I purchased this so that I could have a compact, lightweight monopod to travel and hike with that could also be used as a tripod in a pinch.Weight:  VERY heavy considering it's size.  My full-size carbon fiber tripod with ball head weighs about the same.  This thing would make a good police night stick.  The upside to this is that it feels like a solid, high quality product.Ease of use:  The twist-lock extension is extremely hard to work with.  When you twist it to lock , it can become very difficult to unlock---so much so that Sony had to drill a hold in the side for a knob so you can get extra leverage.  On the other hand, I once had a section collapse down when I didn't twist lock enough.Size:  It's not that compact in reality.  I have a small Manfrotto tripod that I use for flashes that is shorter than this monopod.Tripod Stability:  This was the final decider for returning the multipod.  When used as a tripod at full height, it's just too wobbly.  I put my Nikon D7000 with a small prime lens on it and was scared it would tip over.  This camera/lens combo is below the 4 pound limit Sony suggests and the center of gravity is almost directly over the mount point.  To be fair, the wobbliness has nothing to do with the rigidity of the multipod; it's the small tripod portion supporting weight at that 5 ft. height that's the issue.  Even with a small camcorder or point and shoot (or even nothing at all attached), it's still going to be wobbly just because the multipod is top heavy and the footprint of the tripod portion is so small.Monopod:  Too heavy and too &#34;indoor&#34; to use walking around.  For a wedding, it might be OK, but so would any simple monopod.Ball head:  The included ball head is very basic and small.  I had difficulty getting the camera mound locked into the head at times.  The multipod does have a standard screw-on top, though, so you can fit any head you currently own to it.Versatility:  The multipod does all it advertises--and that may be it's biggest flaw and the reason it and any others designed to do everything will ultimately prove unsatisfactory.  You can't make a minivan into a sports car and maybe you can't make a single camera mount into every mount you might need.Price:  I got this during a Black Cyber Friday Monday deal for a great price.  At it's regular price point, and given it's limitations, it's not worth anything close to what Sony believes.  I can certainly see how much R&D; is tied up in this and how much attention was paid to quality control, but it's just not worth it.Positives:  The tripod portion makes a GREAT tabletop tripod.  The bag reconfigures into any size you need and is very very cool with it's ability to be used as a &#34;flag holder&#34; (see the pics).  Construction feels very high quality.Recommendation:  If you are thinking about ordering this, I'd look at it as a great table top tripod with an occasional use as a monopod or tripod (if no kids, dogs, etc. will bump into it).  Also, if someone breaks into your house, you can always beat them over the head with it.Maybe next time, Sony.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Nice prototype.

In terms of best value the GR06 wins hands down, I actually prefer them over the TF10's and Sony MDREX 600 for outside of the house use. The Fit is excellent they give you a bunch of different tips although I still couldn't get one that gave me a snug fit, I purchased Sony Hybrid tips and they gave me the perfect fit and seal (for use at the gym). The profile or look of the headphones is also excellent, my major gripe with the Sony Ex600's and TF10's was that I couldn't get over how big they looked or how dumb I looked wearing them outside, I tried to get over the who cares how you look as long as they sound good but in the end couldn't. I also couldn't get a good fit with the Sony Ex600's or good isolation (picked up the most outside noise). The TF10's stick out of your ear and got uncomfortable over time, but the Vsonic GR06 fit the best providing the best fit and isolation (prob rate 8-10 you can still hear some outside noise once in a while). In terms of sound quality I would give it a 9/10 (for the price), I remember purchasing the Klipsch S4 and being extremely disappointed after all the hype but I was extremely impressed after not knowing what to expect from this little known company. The only headphones that sounded better to me were the Shure eC3, Sony Ex 600 and TF10's, the GR06 is either half or 1/3rd of the price. Some cons is that the GR06 doesn't have replaceable cables, although I have read from numerous forums that Vsonic has excellent build quality and no one has and an issue with the wires it still would've been nice just in case, but then again replaceable cables are only found on higher end headphones (I ended up getting the GR07 as well for non gym use to replace my TF10's and they don't have replaceable cables either..fingers crossed).I wouldn't consider myself and audiophile, I don't understand the concepts of soundstage, drivers and etc but I do know what sounds good to me and these sound good to me. I would highly recommend these for anyone looking to replace apple headphones, stock headphones or just want the best bang for your buck headphone under $100, there maybe some better options right at the $100 during amazon sales (TF10's, UE 700, etc) but there is nothing normally under $100 or even at $50 for that matter that can compete with these.

It's fast, very fast, very thin & light, runs most apps without any issues (some apps won't work with it but this is only because the developers haven't put it on the list of compatible devices.  i.e. Lets Golf 3 won't run on it, I'm sure it will be updated to work though.  This tablet definitely has enough power to run it).  There's no way I've found to root it yet though.  I'll keep it as I'm sure someone will come up with a way sooner than later.Some other reviewers have said the sound is too low.  This is fixable by going into the audio enhancement settings and click on SRS sound boost.  With this on the volume is just fine.  The stereo separation is very good too (two speakers located on the bottom side of the device)This tablet has a pretty big proprietary connector on the supplied USB cable. It should last a while, it better be tough for the size of it.  This brings up an interesting point.  When you plug in the tablet with this cable to your computer, nothing happens other than it will charge the tablet.  On all of our computers (5 of them) windows wouldn't recognize the tablet was attached.  When you plug in the tablet with a micro USB cable the computer will recognize it.  It's a bummer they use a huge connector on a cable that only charges the tablet and then only at 5v.  Takes a long time to charge.  On the upside you can use external battery pack chargers (you can get 10000+mAh batteries for around $60 on Amazon that will provide a lot of spare power.Toshiba tech support from my limited experience with them is awful.  I called about transferring files via the supplied cable and they were no help.I also had an issue using the USB host functionality trying to use an external hard drive and found via their tech support it will only support drives formatted to exFAT, FAT or FAT32.  DOES NOT support drives formatted to NTFS.  This is very odd...  I had to back up a 750GB Oyen Digital hard drive, reformat it and then transfer the files (mostly movies and TV shows) back to it.  Took forever.  Now that the drive is formatted to exFAT it works perfectly.  Just plug it in using a micro USB host cable (purchased separately) and viola, it shows up on the file explorer (both the stock file explorer and ES file explorer).PROS:* It's very light and thin* It's super-fast.  I scored a little over 10300 on AnTuTu benchmark, and this is with the tablet loaded up with apps (my xoom would only do 6700 or so).  Once I can root it and overclock it a bit I'm sure it'll be one of the fastest tablets around.* Full sized SD card support.  I'm using a 64GB card and it works great.  I'm sure it'll handle a 128GB card.  If I spring for one I'll update this review if it doesn't.* Some of the bloatware is un-installable (the demo app, games etc.).  You don't need to unable them, but that is an option if you want to keep them on the device.* Screen image is sharp (although there is a fair amount of light bleed - see the cons)* Gorilla Glass* Handles 1080p video well, although the native video players doesn't handle many video formats. Use \"MX Player\", free on the market and will play anything.* Screen is very responsive.  Almost too responsive, when you go to touch an icon if your finger is moving at all left or right it will start to scroll the page and you'll need to touch the icon again to open the app.* Very good wifi and GPS reception.* Stock browser works great.  Haven't had a force close yet (this would happen all the time on my Xoom, even after I upgraded it to ICS).* USB host functionality is great (many devices need to be rooted to get this to work).* Charging off of a standard USB port is nice, but it takes a long time to fully charge.* Battery life is pretty good.  I've been getting around 8 hours of actual use (mix of streaming vids, checking email, etc).* Boot time is fast.  I clocked 55 seconds from off to the lock screen showing up and then another 10-15 seconds for widgets to load.CONS:* Lots of light bleed.  Not very noticeable if you're watching something with a lot of light but during dark scenes it's a little annoying.* Proprietary charging cable that only seems to charge the tablet.* Charging takes a looong time* No way to root yet.  After some digging around it looks like it might be awhile before a rooting method is released...

{"reviewerID": "A23QII83UGZP5U", "asin": "B007OWZRC8", "reviewerName": "Wayne \"Omegafiler\"", "helpful": [198, 215], "reviewText": "So far I've owned the ASUS Transformer Prime (TF201), Acer Iconia Tab A510, and now the Toshiba AT305. The TF201 had build quality and wireless/GPS issues and the A510 had a \"grid effect\" to the LCD and some bad heat issues (106+ degrees). And now the AT305, which has light bleed issues. The sad part is that despite this annoying \"issue,\" it's still the best Tegra 3 tablet out there.As with the Acer and Asus, I've already gone through two AT305's just to make sure these issues were consistent. But let's go into a bit more of a detailed review first on the AT305 that I've been using for a few days now.DESIGN:Out of the box, initial impressions are very good. The tablet has a great solid feel to it, it's comfortable to hold, thin, and yes, even light weight. The back has a hard, smooth, plastic feel to it - although I hear its aluminum. If so, it probably has some type of coating on it. Basically, it's one nice looking tablet.I won't go into details regarding where everything is or what feature it has, as you can easily see this from the pictures. Although the one item I must point out is the SD Card Slot, which is on the right side. There is a blank filler card that must be removed when you want to use your own SD card. While the addition of a full-size SD slot is very welcome, there is nothing to cover the slot once your card is in there.So your hand will frequently rub against the sharp inside edges of the plastic casing. I'm normally not a big fan of plastic covers, but in this instance, it would have been very nice to have. If you're planning on getting a case, this won't likely be an issue.WIRELESS:I've tested both wireless and GPS extensively and found them to both perform very well. I'm able to maintain a solid WiFi connection even at the furthest reaches of my Access Point. And GPS can actually pick up a few satellite in-doors, which is always impressive. Outside I can get accuracy down to less than 18ft, within 1-2 minutes. This of course was verified with the GPS Test application.PERFORMANCE:Overall the device is very snappy and I haven't had any issues that I didn't run into with the other Tegra3 devices on Android 4.0.3. There are still a few occasional bugs or glitches with ICS, which I hope they'll resolve soon. Otherwise, nothing specific to the AT305.Antutu scored a 10,313 and Quadrant is right at 4,000.  I've seen slightly higher Antutu scores on the A510, which was closer to 11k. Although as I recall, this is the highest Quadrant score I've seen to date. Keeping in mind that both devices I had scored nearly identical. And in either case, the scores are subjective and personally don't put a whole lot of faith in them.Until they have some new benchmarks that really take advange of the quad core CPU and Tegra3, they're just something to give you interesting numbers to look at. :) Real world tests are where it's at. Speaking of which, playing Tegra 3 games is smooth and they all run expectedly nice. Surfing the web, running apps, and other such tasks are all as expected. Quite good.After watching movies and playing games, I got temps as high as 93 degrees on the back, right side. This was determined by my infrared thermometer. It's not as cool as the 85 degree TF201 but also nowhere near the 106+ degree A510. So I consider that to be on the warm side, but not uncomfortably so. I think the material on the back Toshiba uses helps to dissipate the heat so it doesn't \"feel\" hot or uncomfortable.While surfing or running normal apps, the temps were staying in the 80's where it should be.DISPLAY:Starting positive here, the LCD does look very nice. In fact, of the TF201 and A510, it's the nicest I've seen. Even though it's not IPS (it's TFT as I recall), it looks great. The images are very crisp, colors are vibrant, and it has surprisingly good contrast ratio. The best part is that they've found a very nice color temperature balance.While the A510 was very cool and the TF201 was on the warm side, I found the AT305 to quite neutral. This makes it very pleasing to use whether you are reading, surfing, playing games, or watching a movie.But of course we can't ignore the negative part of this. There is light bleed, and it just makes me very sad. You won't notice this on any normal colorful image. But if you're watching a movie or looking at a picture that has a black background at the edges, you'll see a very uneven amount of light emitting from the sides. And the more you turn up the brightness, the worse it is.In fact, just powering on the tablet, you'll see this on the Toshiba logo as it has a black background. It was exactly the same with both AT305's I got. And it's not something I ever experienced with any other tablet I've owned or used. Normally, this is considered a defect and swapping it out would resolve the issue. But based on my experience and countless other reviews/posts on-line, this is quite common with the AT305.Whether you call it a defect, poor build quality, or a cheap display, it's not desirable.BATTERY:Just in general, when you make something smaller, you tend to make some sacrifices. In this case, it was the battery life. To test it out, I started with a fully charged battery. Then basically used it non-stop until I got down to 20% remaining, at which point we were right at 6 hours of usage. This isn't very good. Although keeping mind this is \"heavy\" usage. I was downloading a bunch of apps, playing games, watching movies, and even ran a benchmark or two during that time.So I'd say heavy usage, you're looking at 7+ hours. Personally I don't like allowing the battery get much lower than 20%, so that's normally about the time I'm looking for a power cord. And yes, the power adapter is straight out of the 90's. There's no reason it needs to be that big; but it is, and I got over it.For me, with \"normal usage,\" I'm easily lasting the entire day on a single charge. This is mostly because I don't use it non-stop and spend most of the time checking e-mail or surfing the web. And overall, it's a fair compromise for its light weight and thinness.SPEAKERS:As with the A510, the AT305 has down-firing speakers at the bottom, and there are in fact two of them (unlike the TF201). They are backed by Toshiba and SRS enhancements, which are definitely needed. If these sound enhancements are turned off, the sound is horrible. But with them on, the speakers actually sound pretty descent.I do suggest turning on the \"boost\" function if it's not loud enough. Surprisingly even with that turned on and volume maxed out, there is no distortion. The A510's speakers still sound noticeably better as there is most detail and they have a fuller sound. The TF305 has a tendency to sound a bit muffled at times, depending on how you're holding it.I still wish they'd put them forward facing. Otherwise, I find them perfectly acceptable and wouldn't mind watching a few shows or demoing the device to friends.So let's wrap this one up.Pros:+ Looks very nice+ Light weight and thin+ Tegra 3 Performance+ Full-size SD Card Slot+ USB functionality+ Descent stereo speakers+ Gorilla GlassCons:- LCD Light Bleed- Only \"OK\" battery life- No SD Card Slot Cover (when in use)- Considering specs (16GB model), could be a bit cheaperCONCLUSION:So how bad is the light bleed? It's annoying enough that this is getting returned. I've been in the IT field for nearly 2 decades and have repaired so many computers and electronics (including many LCD's), I wouldn't even want to guess as to how many. In other words, I know a defect when I see one. :)  However, my lovely wife did play with this for a while and she did \"volunteer\" to take it off my hands - even after showing her the light bleed. It didn't bother her one bit, which I'm sure will be the case for many other folks out there.So my search for a solid Android tablet continues. On the plus side, I think we're getting closer! Just give me all of the good features from Asus, Acer, and Toshiba, and we'll have one killer tablet on our hands. Come on folks, it can't be that hard to spend $400-$500 on a tablet without making compromises.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Best Tegra3 Android Tablet So far... unfortunately.", "unixReviewTime": 1337126400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2012"}

The more I used my smartphone, a Droid Maxx, the more I wanted a tablet so I could do the same stuff only on a larger screen including reading my Kindle books.  After the arrival of the  new Kindle I got serious about comparison tablet shopping. I decided that I wanted to keep the same size as my old kindle - not the screen size but overall size as you can hold it in one hand and its very portable in a purse etc.  I also didn't want the high price iPad or the new Windows tablet. (I have a laptop for serious work.)  So I eventually narrowed down the choice between the Kindle Fire HD, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\" and the Google Nexus. After much analysis and reading reviews I chose the Galaxy for the following reasons: While I love Amazon, I prefer to stay with the Andriod OS so that I don't have to learn a whole other way of life and can set up my devices similiarly; For about $40 more the Galaxy is expandable with a 32GB memory card and it has a front & rear camera;  the Nexus costs more isn't expandable and only has one camera. These are just a few reasons.  I have forgotten the rest cause I am so pleased with my choice.  I have owned it for 4 days now and have some basic things set up on it and will start to play with the camera etc. I had no problems with it recognizing our WiFi. I just have to remember to turn off the WiFi to save the battery life as I did on my Kindle.I bought the Supcase cover for it which fits perfectly and allows for 3 viewing positions and great protection.  I had purchased clear screen protectors but have now ordered non-glare ones as I like to read outside and prefer not to see my reflection while reading!  I spent alot of time studying all the information on the tablets, screen protectors and cases and I am very pleased with my choice and the prices from Amazon.10/10/12  Yesterday I received the Clear Shield Utra Matte finish screen protectors.  It works great...no more glare but you do loose a litte in clarity but worth it outdoors.  The protector was easy to put on and a perfect fit.

I had my laptop, and my smart phone, and couldn't see how a third device could fulfill me any more than what I already had. Enter the Kindle Fire. After many months of hinting/cajoling/begging/whining I made sure my wife got a Fire for Mothers day, which of course required some setup by me, and I said to myself, \"Self, this is almost a really good device. With a bigger screen, a little more storage space, and a little more customizability, this would be awesome.\"I almost made a misstep. I very nearly purchased a refurbed Motorola Xoom, but fortunately did my homework, and landed on the Asus Transformer Pad as the device for me. The hardware packaged inside the Transformer Pad appears to be unmatched in a dollar/performance comparison with any other tablet currently available, and the package itself is very attractive to my eyes. The features available both software and hardware wise have seen me using my laptop much less, and my tablet much more. So far I have purchased a very nice, and inexpensive case for protection, and the dock/USB adapter. The USB adapter has allowed me to connect storage devices from USB thumb drives, to a USB floppy drive - and they all just work. I connected an XBox 360 controller USB wireless adapter, synced a controller, and it worked. Every app I've thrown at it, works. The video editor \"Movie Studio\" works. Battery life is phenomenal whether the Pad is on, or off. Threw in a 32GB MicroSD card and loaded it up with music, and again, everything works. Overwhelmingly, I have had pleasant experiences with the Asus Transformer Pad TF300T, and am looking forward to a long time enjoying my purchase, especially if I can ever bring myself around to getting the keyboard/dock to go along with it.Of course, not everything is roses. For completeness sake; a list of the foibles that I don't care for.The dock connector: I would much prefer a standard micro USB connector - since that's what every other device I have uses for charging and communications.The speakers: Sound quality is great, but with the speakers right next to each other there's no stereo separation. Which begs the question, why have two speakers?The MicroSD card has popped out once. I don't think it will be a problem in general, but I did manage to hit it just right once to unintentionally pop it into the ejected position.Charging: Due to the large battery, it only charges correctly when connected to high voltage/USB3 connections.The internet Browser: As mentioned elsewhere, the browser does \"hang up\" for several seconds many times just before the page completes loading. Not every time, but it can get annoying.It's too big to use comfortably as a reader sometimes - like laying down to sleep - this is the one area where the Kindle Fire comes out ahead.None of these issues I have are anywhere near deal breakers, and most likely there will never be a device that is perfect, so my recommendation is definitely to buy if you're in the market. Again, I am very satisfied with my nearly four-hundred dollar purchase, and in comparison with the similar devices I've seen (the \"New\" iPad, Galaxy Tabs, Kindle Fire), I think my Transformer Pad takes the cake.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It's hard not to like", "unixReviewTime": 1340323200, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2012"}

The front cover is the same color and finish as the back of the Ipad, which is nice.  It is slim, and not bulky like the Clamcase.-Super easy to set up.

The Ipad is not going anywhere.-Unlike many other reviewers, I had absolutely no issue with the magnets used to connect the cover to the Ipad when it not being used.  This was my biggest worry, but it is an absolute non factor for me.  Maybe Logitech corrected an earlier design flaw, or maybe the magnets will weaken over time.  Who knows.  I can only tell you that the cover stays closed and secure for me.  I even tried to make the cover and the Ipad slide apart and I couldn't (without a **tremendous** amount of effort).-Keyboard is obviously not a full size keyboard, but I found it very easy to type on.  Good tactile feel, and dead on accuracy.  It takes a slight bit of getting used to, again because it is not a full size keyboard, but nothing that will bother you.-Special function keys unique to the Ipad are nice-Very quick and easy to remove the case if you want to use the Ipad by itself.-Supposedly you get 6 months of battery life per charge.  Pretty amazing.The negatives:-This is not a case that offers any kind of real protection.  The back of the Ipad is totally exposed, and in the event of a drop, I can't see this offering very much protection to the front either.  Just know that going in.  There are other cases that are bulkier and less attractive, but that offer greater protection.  I didn't buy this cover for the protection, so I am ok with it. I may eventually get a protective sleeve for travel (anybody have any good recommendations?).-Black piano finish is a fingerprint magnet.-Not really an option to use your Ipad in portrait mode with this case.  You can do it, but it not very secure because the magnets are designed to hold the Ipad in landscape mode. Not a big deal for me, but just be aware.-Pricey @ $99, but in my opinion, worth it.Overall, even with the few negatives, I am giving this a 4 star rating.  I like it, and as long as it holds up, I am a happy camper.  If I run into any durability issues, I will post updates.**Update 8/9/12** Bought the Targus Hughes Leather Portfolio for Ipad (available here on Amazon) and it is the perfect companion to the Logitech case. With the Logitech case on, my Ipad fits securely and attractively inside the Targus portfolio.  I will really only use the extra protection when I (or my kids) are using the Ipad away from home, but it's nice to have when I need it.  For those of you who are worried about scratching the back of your Ipad, or about the Logitech case failing to securely close (which has not been a problem at all for me), or just looking for some extra protection, then I highly recommend the Targus case.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Love it for what it is, but just know you're not getting any real protection", "unixReviewTime": 1343001600, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2012"}

I had to turn my remote speakers up to full volume just to hear the music at normal volume. This is obviously a problem as, when I would switch to radio (usually at another time or day), the speaker would be at full volume!Also, a human body can impact the Bluetooth signal.

Presumably to alert you that, it is not getting a signal. But, if the speakers are off, it should just be \"off\" itself. The flashing can be quite annoying. The only solution is to unplug it each time. Forget about leaving it in all the time.With these problems, I ended up returning it.I wonder: are the more expensive variants of this are better with sound levels, flashing LED, and Bluetooth? If so, they would be worth considering. I think this one uses a version of Bluetooth that is 1.X but the more expensive variants use 2.x which has A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) for true stereo sound.If there were a Wi-Fi version of this device, it would be much better and not all that much bigger.

After searching the various motherboard vendors I finally settled on this H77 full ATX motherboard, which, while it has its layout issues, has otherwise been a fine choice.I looked at how I use my computer, and I only run a single, good video card, and I planned to swap out my raid-10 with a raid-1 with a solid state drive for caching using Intel's SRT. The money I saved over a Z77 motherboard afforded me the SSD, and I can assure you that it's well worth the ticket price to get one. I rarely hear the hard drive these days and everything loads faster and smoother. The H77 and Z77 (along with the Z68) provides this feature, while the overclocking Z75 does not. I also realized, as you can imagine, that I don't need a heck of a lot of ports - only running three things that would need a SATA port, a USB hub provides all of the USB 2.0 connectivity that I need, and this motherboard comes with the header port to connect my front case USB 3.0 ports, so all set there. Nothing was especially difficult to connect or work with when installing the motherboard. The BIOS upgraded without incident using a USB stick.First, the good: It's been up and running without a hitch since I installed it roughly a month ago. Everything works as advertised, which is primarily what I'm looking for in a motherboard. I chose to go with a separate SATA for speed and cost reasons, but there is an mSATA port which would likely work out quite well if you went that route. The Atheros LAN chipset, which I hadn't previously experienced first hand, has also run without incident.Now, the not so good. Rear port layout is an issue with all of the Ivy Bridge motherboards, primarily because they want you to use the Lucid MVP technology, which the general assessment is hit or miss. So they provide a ridiculous amount of video connectivity options in the back where there should be USB ports or something similar. This board is in that same boat, with what I'd call a dearth of USB ports - simply a sign of the times. The next is the full x16 PCIe slot - PCIe 3.0 capable. If you run a dual-slot video card, as I do, it effectively stops you from using the x1 PCIe slot underneath it. If you were to run two video cards, depending on the length, you would likely run into issues trying to work with the SATA ports. Lastly, the choice of two PCI slots at the bottom of the board is hard to fathom - I'd much rather have seen them slide one of the PCIe x1 ports towards the bottom rather than letting it sit there unused.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent board for those not needing overclocking", "unixReviewTime": 1341532800, "reviewTime": "07 6, 2012"}

Pleather would have been no worse. And this was inexcusable--even a bit insulting--in a pricey cover. Surely Amazon could have done better at the price point.Second, the cover flap on the case lacked any sort of closure, which left the screen vulnerable to damage when being carried in a bag. I ended up using a rubber band around my cover, but again, Amazon should have thought this issue through considering the price.Well, I'm happy to report that Amazon listened to its customers, and corrected those two mistakes in the Paperwhite leather cover. For my priorities (which may not be yours), it's now perfect.It retains the snap-in, form fitting design from the Touch cover, which means that it adds the absolute minimum in size and weight to a naked PW, while still providing total protection.The leather is now cushioned a bit and textured, giving the case a much more luxurious feel in the hand. It now looks and feels like a case worth its price.The magnetic closure insures that the cover flap stays shut when not in use, protecting the screen, and also serves as an automatic \"off\" switch when you close it.With the PW bezel now virtually flush with the screen, that extra bit of holding room the case provides around the bezel really helps to keep your fingers off the screen. (And fingers inadvertently hitting a touch screen can be a real pain.)I would highly recommend this case to anyone for whom the price isn't an issue, except for those who prefer to use their Kindles naked.

I upgraded from the WRT54G as it couldn't keep up with our internet connection speed 100/50 ( we were only getting about 25 down on WRT54G). I saw this on small net builder and purchased it because of the routing performance (700+ MBPS), so this will last me years to come as we upgrade our internet connection down the line.I didn't need wireless because i have dedicated WAPs mounted on the 2nd and 3rd floor ceiling for better converge. As for the routing performance, I haven't had any problems yet, i only did notice i couldn't get into the web interface once when users were downloading large files, maybe enabling QOS might help. The gui needs a bit of work in some places, as some of the menus are not intuitive im hoping that will come with future firmware updates. I haven't tried the VPN but i hear it works well. I am using a third party VPN server on another machine because it does not have a layer 2 VPN server which i need for certain other apps that work on broadcasts. So i can't comment on the router's VPN performance or functionality. Setup was easy right out of the box and i had no issues with getting this thing up and running.From reading the reviews about the interface being slow, its NOT TOO BAD as some say. I'm using firmware 1.0.1.9 and it takes about 5 seconds on SOME tabs to navigate. Others are snappy, i guess it depends on what section you are in. Boot time is about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, not 5 as someone has stated. Once this is setup and done, you really wont need to go back in ever unless you need to add port forwarding or such, but otherwise one might get frustrated at the speed if they had to go into this thing every other day. I hear users complaining about it being complex... this is a business router with business features. If you are not familiar with the terminology, you shouldn't be shopping in this segment. With complexity comes power and flexibility, which is why Cisco is on top of others in the router business.As a sum up, I mainly bought this for routing speed which it does deliver. It does need work on the gui, but over all not bad. There's not many vanilla routers out there these days without wireless as most people are looking for an all in one solution. I see a lot of potential in this product and room for improvements, mainly around gui usability.Here are some missing features that would make this a 5 star router.* Add button next to the DHCP clients to add a mac to the static pool, you currently have to copy manually, a pain if you need to add multiple static entries.* Better DHCP client name detection (My old WRT54G detected more device names under the DCHP users than the RV180) This make it easier to identify a DCHP client by computer name and such.* Better Bandwidth Counter, the one included is simple counts bandwidth total from a specific date. Would be nice to break down to days, weeks, etc.*  A current traffic meter page to show you how much traffic is going through the wan interfaces at a given moment, a must for a business router.* Current Bandwidth usage breakdown by IP, nice feature to find bandwidth hogs* Total downloaded MB by IP* Speed improvements for gui would help* SSH for basic commands* Layer 2 VPN server (Not likely but would be nice)it's not a bad product does the job but could be better with the above improvements.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It's Ok", "unixReviewTime": 1344297600, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2012"}

Why the iPad compartment is not heavily padded is puzzling. If the adjoining pocket is packed tightly, there is little protection for the iPad other than light padding between the layers of nylon. The laptop compartment seems adequately padded, as does the back of the pack.The Targus C4 Laptop Backpack is a good pack for overall use, like going to class, the library, coffee shop, etc..

The guys and gals at Skinomi really set the bar for me. I know that sounds like hyperbole, but I was really impressed.In a nutshell, I flubbed the install of my screen protector (lots of lint and dust got under the screen). Daringly (or stupidly?), I pulled that protector off my Galaxy 2 after twenty-four hours and with zero application solution left. On the plus side, it was reassuring that the protector not only was a beast to pull off, but as much as I pulled and pried it, it did not loose its shape. So to me, that says its quality and that I got what I paid for.At this point, I thought I was done. I destroyed the protector (it was covered in lint and junk), I have no more application solution, and overall, I felt kind of dumb. I emailed the Skinomi CSR's for guidance and they sent me out a brand new one! But because I'm very good at ruining a free lunch, I replied that I really just wanted some more solution (I am but a man, and I therefore had to make that first protector work. It was a matter of pride. Guys are weird like that). The rep told me that I could just wash off the protector in lukewarm water with some dish soap and let it dry (I let mine dry in a Tupperware container so that the dust in my house wouldn't adhere to the film). The same rep also said that a bit of lukewarm tap water in the solution works fine due to the residual solution. It would likely work only once, though.As you can guess, I was able to reapply the original screen protector, this time without a hitch. And the second one is still en route!What I guess I'm saying is that the people at Skinomi could have taken me for a ride and not even bought me dinner. They could have told me that I need to buy another kit. They didn't They essentially lost money by telling me how I could rescue my botched install. I think that alone is worthy of high marks.

From what I've read, a stylus is a fairly short-lived instrument, with a life expectancy of only a few months, so this, I suppose, falls within \"acceptable\" bounds. Sadly, though, I now have this very well-made barrel, with no way to repair the tip. It's too nice to just simply toss, so now it just mocks me. I'm pleased to see the emergence of styli with replaceable tips -- that makes much more sense to me.Original review (Dec 2012): I specifically ordered this stylus because it claimed to be \"slim,\" because I'd like a finer touch than either my finger or regular stylus can provide. I had hoped for a firmer, smaller \"point\" for detail work, but this stylus has the same-sized rubber bubble as the ones I bought at 3/$1.That said, this stylus is very well made, of much higher quality than the cheap ones, with nicely finished details such as the bezel surrounding the rubber bubble. This stylus is roughly the length and circumference of a regular gel pen, and I find it more natural and comfortable to hold than the smaller versions.Are these refinements worth $10? Only you can decide. The cheap ones do the same job, and if the rubber tip comes off, at 33 cents it's no tragedy. Had this been a *slim* stylus as described, I would have considered my $$ well spent. As is, I won't be returning it, because it's nice and I suck at returns, but I wouldn't have bought it, nor would I recommend it to anyone not specifically searching for a higher-end stylus.My rating is high for the quality, but the misleading description was a disappointment.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good, quality stylus, but definitely not slim.", "unixReviewTime": 1354579200, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2012"}

I bought the Polaroid just to play around with, whereas my Nexus is my \"real\" tablet.  I've owned both for less than a month.  My evaluation admittedly compares the Polaroid to the Nexus.  This may be an unfair comparison, since they are not really in the same league.I give the Nexus five stars, and the Polaroid tablet about half that.  The Polaroid is not a bad tablet for what it does and what it cost (I got it for $72, which included a 20 percent discount off the advertised price).  Thus the Polaroid cost me less than one third the cost of the Nexus.The Polaroid is noticeably slower to start up, and has frequent response lags.  I'm not sure what it's doing when it pauses.  The Polaroid screen often switches off for no apparent reason.  But, the Polaroid Wi-Fi actually seems to be more sensitive than the Nexus.  At least the Polaroid reports a stronger and faster signal.  The Nexus has a slightly better operating system (Android 4.1), whereas the Polaroid has Android 4.0.  However, the difference may not be that significant for most users.It's actually possible to read tiny fonts on Web pages on the Nexus.  Not so with the Polaroid.  The Nexus display is sharp and beautiful, compared to the grainy resolution of the Polaroid.  The Nexus also has important features, like GPS and Gorilla Glass, missing on the Polaroid.I installed Google Market and Amazon Apps Store on the Polaroid, I downloaded all the free apps I'm likely to use, and there is still plenty of RAM to spare.  The Polaroid accepts up to a 32 GB micro SD card, so storage of music, video, and other files should not be an issue.  I haven't even tried out the music and video capabilities on either tablet.  My Nexus and Polaroid tablets have pretty much the same apps, and can do about the same things.  However, the Nexus is much faster and the display is prettier.The main issues I have with the Polaroid are the slow processor and poor screen resolution.  But, if the Polaroid is half as good as the Nexus, at one third the cost, is it a good value?  You be the judge.  If I lose or break the Polaroid tablet, I won't be out much.  I'll cry if the same happens to the Nexus.  I love the Nexus, whereas the Polaroid is merely OK.Sept 24, 2012 Update:  Since the Polaroid has no GPS, GasBuddy App won't install.  I miss that.  The Web version of GasBuddy can be used, however the functionality is not as nice.  In many applications, the Home key doesn't function.  I have to use the Back key to get to Home.  Slow processor performance and slow Web page loading are gettting more exasperating.Aug 17, 2013 Update:  I still play around with and try to use this tablet, but I am about ready to abandon it to the electronics recyclers.  It simply is too slow to be useful.  The Home Key (both physical button and screen icon) is totally dead.  Web pages of any type are so slow to load, the browser times out.

Still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music.Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card didn't show up on the phone this afternoon.  No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone.  I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card.  I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been missing.  I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card.December 6Well, I don't know what to think.  The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem.  The whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud.  I tried several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from.  So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt/extSdCard/Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders.  It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available.The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem.Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone.  I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone.  Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders.  The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted.I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3.  I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone.  That card was not large enough to held my music so I don't know if it was disappearing or not.  I wish this combination of phone and 64GB card was more reliable but just don't know where the problem lies.I lowered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don't know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both.  All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together.December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted.  I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time.  I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don't think I have tried yet.December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages.  The only fix I have found is to restart the phone.  That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing.  The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and file directory programs do not see any files on the card.  I restart the phone and the files come back.  Very strange.  I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again.December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain.  It is a crap shoot as to if music will play.  I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them.  I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone.

Two 32GB cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32GB cards -- and one 64GB card went into my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone. The second 64GB card's a spare.The Galaxy S3 phone accepted the 64GB MicroSD card with no problems -- except for the fact that my Galaxy S3 only recognizes 59.7GB of the 64GB MicroSD card. I have no idea why it does that and why I lost over 5GB of an empty MicroSD card but I'm okay with that -- I guess. 60GB's is still plenty. The transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone's internal 16GB memory and the 64GB MicroSD card is wayyy faster than the old SanDisk 16GB MicroSD card that was in there.

They're definitely faster than the old 16GB SanDisk MicroSD cards I had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).Now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! I ordered two 32GB along with two 64GB MicroSD cards on August 21 during an Amazon Gold Box sale.

Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\" -- at the time of purchase. They also shipped all four tiny MicroSD card packages in a way over-sized box which the USPS couldn't fit into the mailbox so I had to make a cross-town trip to the US Post Office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box. They could have all four EASILY fit in one small envelope. Even a small padded envelope.

Anyways, for $138 (Walmart price) I find this player to be mediocre at best.I loved the idea of it having a full internet browser. That was my main attraction to it. Unfortunately, not only did the internet portion of the player run entirely too slow but it never would even bring up the browser. Most of the other BR players in its same price range had the other features that it did (3D ready, Wireless/WiFi Ready, Standard DVD Upscaling, internet Apps etc.)So naturally I was disappointed from the get-go. The internet Aps ran slow or not at all from the start. The initial setup took FOREVER. I contribute these issues to the distance my player was from my Cable internet router. I have the fastest service Time Warner sells but because the router and player are on separate floors of the house, I believe the distance caused a bad/slow signal. Funny that my Xbox 360 had zero issues and actually gets a 4 bar connection (the best possible) most times when playing on it. My next step is to hardwire the internet connection to see if that helps. If not, this will be going back to Walmart.As far as the actual Blu Ray disc playing it performed like most would. The player started fairly quickly. The picture and sound were great, as expected. When I inserted a standard def. DVD the upscaling was quite nice. It performed those discs MUCH better than my XBox360 with HDMI OR my component cabled Samsung E360 DVD player. I have also yet to find a disc of any kind that will not play. This whole paragraph was a big positive so I gave the player one star for that and one for the other features (even though they didn't work right.I also hate not having any kind of standard audio or video out. It has HDMI and optical ONLY. The Onkyo TX NR709 receiver that I have this running through does not allow digital signals to come out of Zone 2 so I would not be able to listen to my CD's with this player in both rooms (the other room houses my pool table.) Not good. It would have been worth the sacrifice IF the internet browser had worked.Almost forgot... the Disc to Digital feature... not so much. Non-existent for Samsung as of yet.

I've never owned a desktop for gaming before, and I was looking for something reliable, decent specs, and within price range and boy I have to tell you, this just takes the cake. Beautiful machine. I've had it for about a month now and haven't ran into any problems whatsoever. Perfect for my level of gaming, and it can also of course be upgraded. The processor is great. Computer runs very fast. The video card is beyond decent, and handles high-grade games fairly well. (Skyrim, GTA, Crysis, etc.) The auto-setup for most games reads as high or ultra high, and runs such with very little lag. The only downside is the lack of HDD space. While it says 500GB, keep in mind the Operating System does take up 35GB of space alone, so when it arrives you're left with 465GB of HDD space, and that can fill up fast depending on any files and such you transfer from an old system that had beyond 500GB of space. The upside to that is this tower comes with many HDD bays, so it is not a problem to add your own new ones if you wish. I also was a bit edgy about the power supply. 400W is about pushing the bare minimum to run the CPU itself, so for anyone who is going to have a high end keyboard/mouse or stick LED's in the case, and things to that nature, you might want to consider upgrading to a 750W PSU like I did. Overall, this computer is great, and I HIGHLY recommend it if you were in my position with not a lot of money, but wanting a decent machine, and not entirely knowing what specs to look for, and this would also be a WONDERFUL gift for the holidays coming up!

My Windows 7 machine instantly read it as an external drive.If you want to use the drive as a backup, either wholly or partially, there are installation files on the drive (no CD ... nice, and environmentally friendly :) )for the \"Seagate Dashboard.\" After installing the program and rebooting the computer, you get a very intuitive interface with backup options. Within about thirty seconds I was able to set four custom folders for backup, but if you want a general backup that gets all your non-system files (pictures, music, etc.) it takes one click.You can also determine how often the backup occurs: a snapshot (back up the files as they are now and that's it) or a range of time periods (if you want to backup changes you make; you're given the option of monthly, weekly, daily, hourly or continuously). I also love the fact that you can have a variety of backup plans, so if I wanted to I can save a snapshot of the \"Pictures\" folder while backing up the \"Music\" folder every week and keeping the \"Documents\" folder on a constant backup.The drive backs up everything within a Seagate Dashboard folder on the drive, so even if you are using it as a backup you can use the free space on the drive as a regular external hard drive.Lastly, there's a series of lights on the front that indicate how full the drive is. It's a nice touch to be able to tell at a glance at the drive itself to get a rough idea of how much space you have free.For the range of features, a ton of usage options, and a generally good design, I give this an easy five stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A flexible option for a non-portable external hard drive", "unixReviewTime": 1340841600, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2012"}

The only things that kept this from being a 5 star external hard drive, for me, were that while the speed is fair it isn't exceptionally fast and the design to me is lacking.

The specs are great and the Series 9 has an elegant, slim, solid unibody-type design. I couldn't live with less than 256GB storage and I'm really glad I didn't settle for the 128GB flavor.1) Machine is very fast - boots from cold in less than 10secs, resumes from sleep in less than 2. Incredible. Screams through any task I give it.2) Screen is about right at 1600x900 - enough pixels for side-by-side documents while not requiring a microscope to read text. Screen is matte which is nice but I am not as impressed with the color rendition as others seem to be - it's ok but nothing amazing.3) Battery life is very good - I regularly achieve 8 hours or more which for me effectively equals all day use. Very impressive.4) Audio is OK but I wouldn't use for listening to music. I did have to make a change in the audio settings to boost the max volume to a more usable level (Speaker Properties > Enhancements > Loudness Equalization).5) I liked the fnLock key with its LED which allows me to use the Fn keys for screen system controls (brightness, sound etc) without requiring the Fn button each time.While the Series 9 has a lot going for it I had to make a few adjustments to really enjoy the machine properly:-1) Downgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 7 - just couldn't get on with 8 and needed this to be focused 100% on the desktop experience. During this process I also reclaimed all the drive space partitions which gives me 230GB of usable capacity. Much happier now. YMMV.2) Touchpad - I'm used to a MacBook Pro touchpad which is pretty much perfect (even when running Windows in Bootcamp) and the Series 9 touchpad was unpleasant at first - sometimes selecting when I wanted to scroll, right-clicking when I wanted to left-click etc. In the end I found a different driver for this that solved all these issues (ironically NOT the latest version - the best was Elan version 11.6.4.001 for those interested for themselves). I also disabled right corner clicking and reversed scroll direction (\"natural\"). Feels better now.3) Keyboard backlight - there is no manual control over this if the sensor decides the room is too bright. In my experience there were times I wanted it on but the software refused me (why? let ME decide!). So I blocked the light sensor with a small piece of tape and now I have full control over brightness. Works but I really shouldn't need to do this.4) I had a key (BACKSPACE) that was temperamental - sometimes didn't register key-presses at all. I was almost going to return the machine but thought I'd try a blast of compressed air first from one of those pressurized cans with a straw. Out popped a microscopic piece of plastic debris and Voila! - now it works perfectly.5) The micro-ports are a bit of a pain - not happy about carrying adapters around for Ethernet and VGA but I got used to that with the MacBook Pro VGA dongle (didn't like it there either) and the Series 9 is much thinner - Samsung at least provide the Ethernet adapter in the box. Charger port isn't as elegant as Apple's mag-safe but it does the job.So as you can see with a few software tweaks Samsung could have had a 5-star machine - basically ship with a better touchpad driver and backlight software that gives full control to the user and you're golden.Overall though I now love my Series 9, it just needed a little TLC at the start.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Almost Perfect ...

The other was in typing in long passphrases, when you fill up the field on the screen, you can no longer see what you are typing in the field. I was expecting that it would roll the letters to the left so that I could see the latest characters in the field and be sure that it was all going in correctly. Hopefully they will change this behavior in future releases. I didn't try using it as a router, so I can't speak to that.

At least the entire passphrase can't be seen because of the problem already stated above. I would like it if you could only see the passphrase when you enter it and cannot see it after that.

Coelho", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "First of all here are some of the basics of how this product was tested.* Home office* One computer running Windows Vista 32-bit w/ a wired connection to the router* Comcast cable Internet (non fiberoptic connection)* iOS devices for wireless testing* Router is in a finished basement of a ranch style home (1 story)* Older router being replaced:Linksys Wireless-G 2.4 GHz Wireless RouterPROS================================+ Dual band support, so you can run both a 2.4 gHZ and 5 gHZ wireless network. This is useful as older routers had the option of catering to the lowest common demoninator, but with a dual band router you have the best of both worlds.+ Wireless speeds were blazing fast close and far away from the router. I tested using an iPhone 5, iPad 1 and iPad 2 and all remained consistent in download times of websites right next to the router and on the 1st floor. With the previous router I had issues where the wireless would drop out in certain spots on the 1st floor, but I had no such issues or decreased throughput on this router.+ My job is technical in nature, so I can navigate the advanced setttings on the router pretty easily. However, the quick setup was a breeze and I can see it being very useful for the average user. The ability to auto-detect your Internet connection was especially nice, since it immediately picked up on our cable modem. Most cable modems require a MAC address clone. An average user who plugs in a router doesn't realize this and may end up spending money because the router isn't working. The TP-Link quick setup detected this potential issue and immediately made the suggestion to avoid that problem.+ The support for an external drive or printer via USB is a nice touch at this price point for a router already supporting dual band and great wireless range. I tested this out with a thumb drive and it worked very well. I was able to plug in the thumb drive, enable the drive for internet FTP access and then test it using my iPhone (with the wireless disabled) using LTE. I was able to login and browse the files on the thumb drive. There is a limit per device of 10 folders to share.+ Parental controls were nice at a free price point. Linksys charges for the parental controls on its routers, but the TP-Link allowed setting up some basic controls with no additional cost. I will concede that the Linksys service offers some advanced monitoring features, but it's nice to have basic controls at no additional cost, which for our family serves the purpose.+ Advanced options were extensive and included everything I might need and had with the previous router. For those interested, there is support for Dynamic DNS built in through dyndns.org, comexe.cn and no-ip.com.CONS================================- Size. Footprint on this router is larger than the 4-port wired & wireless router I was previously using. This wasn't an issue for me, but may be for others.- The power cord was about 1' shorter than my previous router, so it's a bit stretched to keep in the same position. The included cord is 5' in length.- This is more of a product improvement for the quick setup, but I think it's worth noting for anyone not very technical. The quick setup does not include the option to change the default username and password. This is a must and I think it should be required as part of the setup. Make sure to click System Tools and then Password to change the defaults.Overall, this is a great router and there are very few shortcomings. I took away half a star for the minor items I listed under the CONS heading. If you are looking for a router above entry level, but below the $100 threshold look no further.********* I received this product for free as part of the Amazon.com Vine program.

Lionel", "helpful": [314, 361], "reviewText": "Pros:+ Fastest dual-band router I have used by far+ Lots of configuration options in admin panel+ DLNA server, FTP server, USB printer server and USB storage serverCons:- Physically large- Admin user interface can be confusingFor the last two-plus years I have been using the Netgear WNDR3700V1 dual-band router. At the time I bought it, it was considered one of the fastest dual-band routers available, and it had lots of features. It does work very well, but Netgear has revised it twice and the subsequent V2 and V3 releases have diminished functionality and performance.  While I have used many brands of routers in the past, TP-Link was new to me so I was curious to see how the TL-WDR4300 compared.The router itself is a large box.  It's attractive and has a nice design, but it is much wider than competing routers. It is also very lightweight. Perhaps the width is so that the three dual-band antennae can be physically separated more - I don't know.  There are keyhole slots on the bottom in case you want to wall-mount it, but as with most all routers, the wiring all goes to the back where the antennae are, so this might be awkward if your wiring comes from below.TP-Link provides a setup \"wizard\" on a mini-CD (you can also download it from their web site), but I just connected to it directly and configured it through the admin panel.  I was delighted to see that the wireless networks came up pre-configured with WPA security and an 8-digit password - many routers are simply \"open\" when first configured. This encourages users to maintain security.  You can set the wireless to WEP or even open if you want, but that's generally ill-advised.Unlike a certain other brand of router I have tried two examples of (cough - D-Link - cough), the TP-Link had no trouble negotiating with the Ethernet feed of my FiOS optical network box (the equivalent of a cable modem).  Some of the configuration features it had that I liked were:- Dynamic DNS support (though the selection of providers was limited)- Separate and easy to understand configuration of 2.4 and 5GHz bands- Ability to reserve IP addresses to specific devicesSome of the things I didn't like:- Only a single display of DHCP clients connected, rather than separating wired from wireless- IP reservation page did not let you select from known connections - you have to type the MAC address- No \"guest mode\" - this is a feature the Netgear WNDR3700 has that adds a second network which can be configured to give Internet access only and not access to your local network.  This is great for houseguests and the like [Edit - TP-Link added Guest Mode in a later firmware update]The admin user interface is straightforward, though it uses submenus and some of the pages seemed to duplicate others.  For example, there were two different pages where one could enter DNS server addresses, and changes to one did not carry over to the other. While each page had pretty good instructions right in the dialog, some of the options were a bit confusing as to how to set them. But what really got me were the pages where I did not notice at first that a frame of the dialog had a scrollbar, and I had to scroll to the right to see additional links, even though there was lots of space for them to show otherwise.  A full manual is on the CD as well as on the web site.Once set up I tested performance at a distance of about 25 feet through two walls. First I ran tests using the Netgear and then the TP-Link with the same remote server.  The TP-Link delivered speeds 30-50% better than the Netgear on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. The Netgear is very good about coverage in my house - it has eight (I think) internal patch antennae where the TP-Link has three, rather tall stick antennae. I found coverage to be at least as good as the Netgear, even about 50-60 feet away and through multiple walls.  I could only go by \"bars\" of signal strength but it seemed to me that the TP-Link's signal was stronger on both bands. Many dual-band routers are particularly weak on the 5GHz band.As the three antennae suggest, this router supports the \"3X\" mode of some Wireless N adapters for a theoretical maximum bandwidth of 450Mbps on the 5GHz band and 300Mbps on the 2.4GHz band.  Add those together and you get the \"750\" emblazoned on the router.  The spec sheet I got indicates tested speeds of 241Mbps and 135Mbps respectively, still not shabby. The Ethernet ports are all Gigabit, and the test indicates LAN-WAN speeds as much as 935Mbps.  That's fast.The TL-WDR4300 has two USB 2.0 ports on back.  These can connect to USB storage or to a USB printer.  For storage the router will make the storage available as a network share, or you can enable an FTP server that can, if you wish, be accessed from the Internet. (The default is off.) Unfortunately, only standard FTP is supported, not SFTP over SSH, so your login information (you can set a username/password pair) is sent unencrypted.  My advice is to NOT use this feature over the Internet.I did not test the print server, as my printer is already network-enabled. For Windows there is a utility you install that, if I understand correctly, pretends to be a USB port and relays information to and from your USB printer.  Scanners are also supported.I did test the DLNA media server.  You can specify up to six folders on the USB storage to serve and it will relay audio, video and photos to DLNA clients on your local network.  I fired up Goodplayer on my iPad and played a movie from a USB hard disk - it worked beautifully.  The promotional material claims that it can serve media over the Internet, but I think this is incorrect - there's no setting to enable/disable it and no instructions for how you would access the media from outside your local network.  I will verify this with TP-Link support and update this review when I learn more. (Edit: TP-Link confirmed that media serving is local network only.)TP-Link's documentation takes the unusual step of saying that one can install and run the freeware DD-WRT router software on some of its routers.  I checked at the DD-WRT web site and while the WDR4300 is not yet officially supported, there is a beta version that at least partially works, and development for the WDR4300 is proceeding.  According to the spec sheet TP-Link included, the WDR4300 has an Atheros chipset that runs at 560MHz, 128MB of RAM and 8MB of flash - these are rather high values for routers in this price range and suggests great performance and resistance to locking up after being on a long time (a problem I have seen with other routers.)Lastly, as I do for most products I test, I looked at power consumption. For a device you'll leave on all the time, this can matter. I was pleased to see that the WDR4300 maxed out at 4 watts with wireless on, where the older Netgear router was averaging 6-7 watts. Excellent.Not only does the TP-Link router seem well-designed, but their web site is easy to navigate as well, unlike those of some more well-known brands.[Edited February 6, 2014 to note that Guest Mode was added after my initial review.]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super-fast, great range, lots of features", "unixReviewTime": 1351036800, "reviewTime": "10 24, 2012"}

It was delivered in less than 24 hours! I mounted it on my D300s and that's where it will stay. I have been using Nikon cameras and lenses for nearly 40 years now, and this lens is something I wish I'd  had 40 years ago! YES, it's a hefty lens (over 2 lbs) and YES it's expensive! But, hey, it's the only one of its kind - 16.7 power optical zoom! (That's 27mm to 450mm in 35mm film terms.) I took several test shots at both ends of the zoom range in RAW format, opened them up in Photoshop CS5 RAW editor and the results were AMAZING! The vibration reduction (VR) has two settings for different shooting situations and you can lock the zoom at 18mm for carrying and easily unlock it to zoom. The VR II in this lens is the best yet! The old-school rule for shutter speeds (use a minimum shutter speed equal to the focal length of the lens) is out the window! I shot several hand held pics while zoomed to 300mm using shutter speeds at 1/15 and 1/30 of a second...no problem. It requires a 77mm filter size - YES they cost more, but the front element of the 18mm to 300mm is close to the end of the lens barrel, so a UV or Sky 1A filter will offer some protection...get one! The lens comes with a hood, pouch and front and rear lens caps, so all you need is a filter to protect it. The lens is about the same overall length as the 55mm - 200mm DX lens, so it fits in my camera bag just fine. The barrel is much larger, tho.So, if you are debating on buying this zoom - buy it! It's the most versatile lens out there for a DX format camera. Did I mention that it will focus to about 18 inches, even at the 300mm setting? That is most useful if you like close up pictures of critters that might bite you! If you have a DX format Nikon, this is the lens to own.Update: The price I paid thru Amazon prime in December, 2012, has dropped $300! It first dropped at B&H; and after I contacted Amazon customer service about it, I have been ignored. Their automated response to customer service is all you can expect. This doesn't refect on the lens - it just reflects on Amazon's way of doing business and ignoring their customers. The other thing that irks me about the situation is that I sold 2 more lenses (to my brother ans a mutual friend). They both spent about $3K based only on my recommendation! I am hoping they will not count on Amazon being competitive - even within their own store! $300 is a chunk of money - that's a 33% drop in price in a 3 month span of time.

It takes some time to learn all of the buttons and commands but it works well.  The box itself is surprisingly small and compact and combines web surfing with Google TV and the Sony entertainment network.The set up can take some time (30 to 45 minutes) which will frustrate some users.  Many commands are hidden under menus and sub-menus.  It is best to explore all of the icons and search google itself when help is needed.  The first time I used it, I walked away from it for a short time and it inexplicably shut down on its own.  I thought it overheated.  However, I found that it was set to shutdown automatically after 30 minutes and after turning this setting off it has stayed on and worked flawlessly ever since.  The unit will update the software automatically the first time it is used.  I found surfing the web to be better than other devices I have used like the PS3 but it is still not as easy as using a computer and a full sized keyboard.  The remote has small buttons that my large fingers could not easily handle but it has a backlight and a \"feel\" to the buttons that help a great deal.The remote itself is very well designed and helps immensely with google search.  It automatically lights up when turned over to the keyboard and has a touch pad on the other side along with some key buttons.  It takes some time to learn to use and feels overwhelming at first and more than once I flipped the remote over so the keyboard was upside-down.  However, this remote is not great for simple tv watching.  I still use my Logitech Harmony for that.Google TV still needs some work but it is improving. It does not support Hulu Plus.  Hulu, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, Comedy Central, and MTV all still blocking Google TV from streaming video on their Web sites.  The $45 offer of free movies is not that good considering the selection is very limited (only 12 movies are offered) and includes older movies or outright junk.Overall, I am still learning to use it and feel it should be much easier for the non-techie to get up and running on.  Hopefully, future software upgrades will address this issue.  At $200 it is pricey and will have to come down in price to be more competitive.  This market is still evolving and it will be interesting to see which device ultimately dominates.UPDATE 1/7/13:  Since posting the above review the device has received several updates that have added content and improved ease of use.

No questions asked and at their expense (overnight shipping too!). So I returned to Cisco SB when shopping for a new router.I purchased the RV042G because it offers gigabit connectivity and two WAN ports coupled with customer service that is miles better than the usual phone tree/call center BS that you get with most consumer grade network gear(including Cisco/Linksys home products). I'm an AT&T; U-verse customer and while their service is good, it's not quite quick enough (12mbps) for my family of iPad/netflix/HBOgo addicts. So the ability to put the router in \"load balancing\" mode and add on a cable modem to give us extra bandwidth was the biggest reason for the upgrade. There is no wireless on this router and for me that's perfect, could be a drawback for some.Setup was very straight forward. I didn't even use the \"set up wizard\". Just changed a few settings through the web interface and it was online in a jiffy. It's probably not as easy as the setup on a typical home unit (ie. airport or Cisco Connect), so a little knowledge of protocols and ports is needed. There are not a lot of parental type controls on the unit. You can block specific domains and key words but I haven't seen any MAC or IP based filtering options in the menus yet, but I wouldn't really expect that given the intended audience for this unit. I'm not using the VPN functions right now, so I can't comment on those. There is only one thing I've found that seemed like an odd limitation of this unit. The DHCP server is limited to 50 clients, additional IP's would have to be assigned static. Overall, I'm really happy with the unit.One last thing. Since this item is not available from Amazon proper, be careful who you buy it from. My first purchase was from Amazon seller \"Nu Image\". Waited more than a week for the unit and when it arrived, it was destroyed. They shipped it USPS packaged only in a plastic bag. They promised me an expedited replacement but days went by and nothing till Amazon issued a refund. When I asked about my replacement, I was told to just start over and order another one. I reordered from Amazon seller \"The Nerds\". Router was shipped via Fedex and was at my door (packed in a proper box) in 2 days and was cheaper to boot.UPDATE 10-12-12:In my previous review I said that I hadn't found a way to set parental controls or do IP based filtering.  I have since discovered how this is done on this router. There is not a parental settings page or anything like that but under the firewall option in the menu, you can set \"access rules\" till your heart is content. As with the basic set up of the unit, some knowledge of TCP/IP ports and services is required to get this set up. Mine is now configured to disallow traffic to my kid's ipods, Nindendo's and TV's after bed time.I'm still very happy with this unit.

While Guetta may not use these headphones for his own mixing, he'll wear them in support of the Beats name.Now to get to the headphone.In my opinion this headphone is an upgrade from the well known Studio model, but you're probably asking \"If this is an upgrade, why is this cheaper than the Studio?\"The answer lies in the build of the headphone, the sound quality, and the fact that they're non-powered.The build of this headphone is almost comparable to that of the Beats Pro which has a metal casing and a driver that cleans up the muddy bass and low end of the amplified Studio model. I like to call this the little brother of the Pro. It's a sturdy, yet compact headphone that's good for listening to a wide variety of music. Mostly Beats is targeted for the audience that listen to Hip-Hop, Rap, R&B;, and anything Techno, Electronica, or Trance related, at least with this guy it is.The sound on these is much brighter than it's predecessors. Monster's Beats by Dre focused primarily on the Mids and Low frequency and equalizing the Bass output on most of their headphones. This headphone however fixes that. The headphone maintains the highs and mids while offering a tighter cleaner bass and treble, so nothing gets completely drowned out. For anyone who listens to different genres, you need a headphone that can do that, and do it sucessfully. Oddly the Mixrs do a good job ( not great ) for that.The last thing I wanted to hit on is that the headphones are in fact non-powered, which is a plus for those who don't like the battery use Studios. The headphones do sound isolated incredibly well for a compact size; even if you crank the volume up to max, they barely bleed out ( I'd say about 2-3% ). The Studios however have a driver that output the music, but because air needs to go through the driver to drive the bass, those bleed out like crazy after you put the volume pass 70%.This isn't a perfect headphone however.Although compact, the headphones are rather tight on the ear, which for some can irritate the heck out of you if you're wearing for long hours. The second issue is the wiring design built into the headphone. Although it's a ribbon cable, I can't shake the fact that it feels flimsy and that it can break at any accidental moment. The last and most important thing is again the price.Most high end headphones these days will hit the 200 Plus price point. This one normally retails for 250 to 280 wherever you can get them, and it might drive people to steer clear from the Beats or any high end headphone to begin with. Personally however if you wanted to get a \"Beats\" headphone, this would be it. You won't need the Solos, the Studios, the Pros, etc. Just this one, because it's not a bad headphone.It's a fun headphone for those who like a little punch in their music. The build is quite good, but if you try comparing it to a Westone or Shure headphone, you're honestly better off buying those instead.  That's all for now :)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not a fan of Beats, but these aren't too bad.", "unixReviewTime": 1337040000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2012"}

I'm also Caucasian, and I'm only stating that because there is a stereotype that this brand is only for the more \"urban\" among us. For awhile, admittedly, I felt that way too. My experience with Beats by Dr. Dre has been abysmal, and I have only ever thought that they were average sounding headphones with an above average border lining excessive price tag. In many respects, that assumption still stands.I, however, am now an owner of the Beats Studios silver color, and I'm thoroughly impressed. I have to say that I was gifted these and did not shell out the money for them, but had I known these we're actually as good as they were I would have definitely considered it. I must stress that the ones I own are not the Monster ones, but the most recent Beats by Dre version. I can tell a difference in build quality as these, with their matte finish, feel and look significantly more stable than the glossy plastic Studios when Dre was still under the Monster label with them. There *is* a difference with these. They don't feel or look as cheap as the ones you see in the retail store demo kiosks.These silver ones not only look good, but they have a classy neutral appearance that works well in an environment where flashy isn't welcome. They are of a medium weight, as in not too light and not heavy at all, and they are extremely comfortable to wear. I wear glasses and was able to wear these for around 3 hours with absolutely zero ear fatigue.Now on to the sound. As I said, I listen to a lot of music from dubstep to classical and video game soundtracks. I am very, very pleased with how everything sounds. The bass is heavy but clean and doesn't seem to explode over everything else. There is some sound leakage around 50% volume on an idevice, but I'm not terrible concerned about it. The noise canceling...it isn't Bose Quiet Comfort 15 quality. If anything, it's active noise reduction instead of cancellation. I'm happy with the quality of it, though, as it does block out a lot of external noise and sound when I am listening to music.Overall, I love these new Studios and I recommend them. I give them 4 out of 5 stars because of the price point. I still believe $299 is a bit high, but if you're going to get a pair of headphones that are Beats by Dre then get the Studios. I stand by my belief and experience that the Beats Pros, Mixrs, and Solo HDs are uncomfortable and have questionable sound in comparison to the Studios.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I'm honestly shocked.", "unixReviewTime": 1349654400, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2012"}

I had deliberated for a few weeks over whether to buy another ASUS product or an alternative brand Android tablet. Eventually I decided to buy the TF700 Infinity, primarily because there was very little else on the market that came close to the specification of the TF700 and I was impatient to get another tablet as I really loved using my TF300. Overall, I am delighted with the TF700, it is a truly wonderful tablet. I've been using it daily for over ten days now so thought that was long enough to give my thoughts.The new full HD Super IPS+ screen offers a fantastic resolution and brightness. While it is true that few Android apps support such a high resolution directly at the time of writing, uses such as the Kindle app and general web browsing look incredible and it is impossible to see any pixelation at all in text and hi-res photos. It really is a joy to behold. However, the primary reason I'm not giving this tablet five stars is also because of the screen - the bottom of my screen suffers from relatively minor light bleed in about four or five places an inch apart from each other and the left edge has two patches on the edge which are darker than the rest of the screen. I can live with this - it's certainly a common problem with tablet screens, (and desktop LCD/LED monitors/TV for that matter.)Having upgraded from a TF300 I was a little disappointed some of my previously bought apps didn't work on the TF700. Most notably, Tiger Woods 12 is listed in the Google Play store as incompatible with the TF700. That's a shame as it was one of the games I loved on my TF300 and I hope EA eventually get round to fixing their code to work on the Infinity and other newer tablets. It's worth saying that most of the apps I'd already previously bought for my TF300 worked fine on the TF700 though - at a rough guess out of over forty (non-Google) apps, only two or three refused to install, or installed then crashed upon running. Of course, all the Google apps work perfectly.Before I bought the TF700, I was a little concerned as to whether the 1.6ghz Tegra 3 would be quick enough to drive the 1920*1200 resolution in 3D games and the like. I needn't have worried - every compatible game I've played on the TF700 works wonderfully. System intensive games such as Riptide GP work great even when upscaled with no noticeable drop in frame-rate, (if there is a drop in frame-rate, I don't notice it.)If I was to pick fault with the tablet, I'd have to say the most disappointing thing is the speaker and its positioning. Being placed on the back, the sound is already directed away from the user and sounds feebler than tablets with front mounted speakers, but when used in a case, (folded open), or when the tablet is laid flat on a desk, the sound is obviously further muffled. It's still audible when used at home, but harder to hear properly when outside or somewhere with ambient background noise. This is nitpicking though - and something that using headphones obviously solves!Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich is a joy to use. That said I am looking forward to the 4.1 Jellybean upgrade when it becomes available after having used it on my wife's Nexus 7. I'm in no particular hurry though as ICS is very stable and well featured. (EDIT 13th October 2012 -- I received the 4.1 Jellybean update wirelessly from ASUS over a week ago and absolutely love it! The upgrade install and setup without any issues and was a very nice surprise.)One thing I was particularly interested in using this tablet for was video calls and plain voice calls using Skype as I have a lot of family in Europe. The Skype app works perfectly - the audio sounds perfectly clear and the video streams without any hiccups.Compared to the TF300, the TF700 appears to be better constructed and solid. The majority of the back of the unit is metal rather than plastic and the unit feels much more sturdier than the previous model. The inclusion of Corning Gorilla Glass is very welcome too compared to whatever the screen covering was on the TF300.If you are looking for a high specification tablet, I would definitely advise you to consider this product. It's great - not perfect, but certainly much closer than any other Android tablet currently available at this price point.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The best Android tablet for the money...easily.", "unixReviewTime": 1344297600, "reviewTime": "08 7, 2012"}
{"reviewerID": "A4YXMH6WB73MN", "asin": "B008F4NL04", "reviewerName": "Jason Harrell", "helpful": [96, 107], "reviewText": "*** Update 11/3/13: So I decided to do an update to my review since there are still people buying this tablet.  Just my two cents.  I do like this tablet, but it has a major I/O bottleneck issue.  You can research this yourself to find out what it really means, but what it comes down to is that the device will slow down and even become choppy.  There are workarounds for it but from what I see it is only minimal performance increase.  As I stated below, when you pay over $500.00 for something, you should be able to install as many apps that you want from the PlayStore and it shouldn't slow things down.  I hear using different browsers helps and uninstalling some apps, but once again, why have a tablet if you can't have all these apps installed, especially when you get a 64 GB model like I did.  I have not rooted, and have not unlocked.  I'm over my year warranty but I'm not one to delve into modifying a device and risk bricking it.  It is still usable, and games run smoothly.  It just isn't up to par with my standards for being really slick.  It started out smooth, but moved on to being jittery and unpredictable at times.  I don't have any screen issues like others have reported.  I have moved my star rating down yet another notch because of these consistent I/O bottleneck issues that haven't been fixed and not sure they can be fixed by OTA updates.  I still like most of the things about this tablet, but I feel that today, there are probably better devices out there.  Maybe they don't have the keyboard dock with the SD card slot, or the Micro SD card slot on the tablet,  HDMI output and USB port that we all love to have, but when it comes down to it, I want a stable smooth product and this just isn't quite living up to my expectations and I am clearly not the only one who loved it at first then became disappointed after a while.*** Update 4/5/13:  Jellybean 4.2 came out the other day, I updated and it works fine.  Please note that Photosphere is not included, apparently this is only on Certain tablets like Nexus 10.  I was hoping for it, but it isn't there.  Also, my tablet is slowing down a good bit and hiccups more than I would like.  I'm considering doing a clean slate format to see if that clears things up a bit.  Overall I'm still happy, but for the specs and money we pay, you would think it would be consistently smooth and it just isn't.  I'm dropping my rating by one star for this.  Keep in mind this is just my experience.  I hear other people say they have no problems at all.  Maybe I have just too many apps installed, but isn't that the purpose of having a tablet?  I have also installed some apps from Amazon's free app of the day, so those can slow it down too I suppose.  I may just format it and only install the stuff I regularly use and see if there is a performance boost.  If I get around to it, I will update to advise how the factory reset worked.  At times there are no issues at all, so who knows what I will do.  PS, mine is not rooted.  I've only done the push notification updates from Asus.*** Update 1/21/13:  Thought I would update to say that I still love my non-rooted Infinity.  There have been a few updates since the Jellybean 4.1.1 came around, and so far everything is going pretty good.  I still notice some hangups here and there when using certain websites on the stock browser.  Many people prefer other browsers so you might want to try those out if the stock it sluggish for you.  The current build number on mine is 10.4.4.25 which is supposed to improve MicroSD card compatibility, guarantees that the music played in the background will no longer have lag if the user is switching between tabs in the browser, and also fixes an issue where some exported videos cannot be played to the end, a few bugs for the camera, Mio map, and movie studio app are fixed.  I have seen a few apps in the store that were not compatible with this tablet.  At this time I don't recall which ones they were, games, or Live wallpapers, or what, but I was surprised.  Most games run silky smooth, but there are some that have glitches.  Facebook is horrible on this tablet, and I'm not sure why.  Pictures are HUGE in your regular news feed.  I wish those were reduced in size unless you click on it, but that is most likely the app, not the tablet.  The latest Youtube app is no longer able to play full screen since it is missing that button, but I hear they may be working on that.  Workaround is to uninstall the updates.Photos have been really smooth in transitions since the latest updates, so now when flipping thru, it is really snappy.  I currently have about 349 apps installed overall.  I'm sure things would run more smoothly if I uninstall some, but where is the fun in that.  I have stuff there for me and other people.  My TF201 keyboard dock works great.  It used to be a tight fit, but now it works perfectly.  I don't notice any other problems with the dock.  GPS locks on lightning fast.  I get over 31 Mbps on Speedtest.net's app.  I do notice significant decrease in Wifi thru just a few walls, but it still works well.  Mt favorite wallpaper, which I chose to buy the full version, is called GyroSpace 3D.  But Planets Pack is great too.  Battery life is great alone, and even better with the keyboard dock.  I still highly recommend this table if you like customizable options.  If you are a stickler for stability, then you may prefer the Apple line of products, but I am very content with my Infinity.Still waiting on the official Jellybean 4.2.  Hope this helps everyone.****Update 10/1/12:  I just received my Jellybean update to version 4.1.1 and so far so smooth.  I do notice a smoother experience while scrolling on the homescreen and in the default browser.  There are a few enhancements to the lock screen and when you press the power button in for a few second you get a few different options.  The upgrade did not delete any apps for those concerned about it.  But it is usually recommended that you backup anything you are concerned about losing.  The Gallery scrolls much more smoothly now.  Very nice.  They added Asus MyFrame in the Live Wallpaper.  Just an overall improvement so far.  And Adobe Flash seems to be working fine on mine.  I will test out more of it tonight and report any odd findings or any cool features.  I'm sure they will be posted somewhere though.  Have fun everyone!!!****Update 8/29/12:  Sorry for the constant updates, but I forgot to include in yesterday's update that I have been experiencing an odd behavior with my Infinity.  I usually use the keyboard-docked Infinity and when done, I just close it to put it to sleep, then when I open it later, all is fine... I may do this a few times, then suddently, here and there when I open it, I get a blank black screen and I have to press and hold the power button for about 10 seconds and it restarts.  This is a little annoying when you want to open it quickly to do something, so I have no idea why it does this.  I always have it docked to the keyboard, so I don't know if that is the underlying problem or if it is something else.  Thought it was worth noting, but not enough to cause me to drop a star rating.****Update 8/28/12:  Time for a much needed update.  So first I'd like to start by saying that I'm very satisfied with the tablet.  It isn't perfect, but it suits my needs.  I have no regrets getting the Infinity.I will let you know that a new problem that I have noticed is sometimes, during some web browsing, the default browser will freeze up and then just close by itself.  The good thing is that when I reopen it, it takes me right back to where I was.  Some sites that I use with a login have quirks that make it annoying, but not enough to make me mad.Another thing I noticed is when playing videos that are at 720p, I notice a little stutter now and then, as if it pauses for a millisecond, but the audio stays in sync.  Doesn't happen all the time, but still happens even when on the Performance mode setting.  I haven't read anything about anyone else having this issue, so maybe I have to adjust something or turn off other apps running in the background.  I thought it was worth mentioning.Games run smoothly, most web browsing is smooth, Youtube plays nicely.  I'm Still happy.****Update 7/27/12:  First off there was an firmare update over the weekend.  For those that don't know, Asus is very good at pushing out updates. This seems like a big one and it only stated that it was to improve performance, but I found an online comment of the changelog, and it was a lot of stuff.  For info, look it up.  firmware v9.4.5.26 should help you find the info.OK, regarding my comment below about Riptide, turns out that it only needed the options tweaked to higher graphics and now it looks a lot better.  I guess the default is the lowest settings to improve performance.  But the Infinity has no problem handling the graphics boosted all the way up to the highest setting.  I'm sure we will still run into some problems with the apps not being enhanced for the 1920  1200 screen.I'm still loving my Infinity.  Hope everyone is having a good experience with their tablet as well, regardless of which brand or model you chose. There is something for everyone.****Update 7/28/12:  Sorry for the constant updates, but I figured some people would want to know any additional info as I find out more info. I loaded Draw Something app and it will not open on my Infinity 64GB.  It loads the company logo then just closes.  I've seen several apps in the Playstore that are not compatible with this device.Also just be careful with the case you order if you get one because several say they are for the Prime and Infinity, but the buttons are located in different places, so it won't work.  I found a nice one which I will review as well.  Fits nice and snug.  It is the Poetic Infinity Case TF700 PU Leather Portfolio Stand for tablet and keyboard dock.  All cameras are viewable without any blockage, just no magnet holding it closed.  I ordered it here at Amazon.After several days playing with the Infinity, i can say that there are slight glitches, but I love it.  I feel that it was well worth the money and the wait.  Just my opinion.****Update 7/26/12:  So I purchased the full version of Riptide GP, and when I started it up, I was disappointed in the graphics this time around.  It looked great on the Prime, very crisp and clean. But on the Infinity, the edges of everything are very jagged including the water splashes on the screen.  I assume that this has to do with the HD screen, and the game wasn't designed for that 1920  1200 full HD screen.  It runs smoothly, but looks crappy.  Hopefully an update will come out that fixes this.  I also got the demo of Puddle, and it looks really bad too.  Let me rephrase that, it doesn't look as good as I thought it would.  Plus the physics of the liquid isn't as smooth as I think it should run.  I'm mentioning these games because I think it has to do with the games not being enhanced for the 1920  1200 screen.  I don't blame the device itself, just the lack of support for now.****Update 7/24/12:  I've browsed some websites, played some games, played some lower res .avi clips, watched some Youtube videos at different qualities, and everything seems very nice and smooth.  There were some minor hiccups in watching some videos at times, but could have been due to many other reasons, like the internet connection at the time, etc.  I've seen that happen on the iPad 2 also.Also, when viewing high resolution photos that I've taken on my digital camera, as soon as you pull up the photo, it starts out looking kind of low resolution, but about 1 second later, it pops into really clear resolution.  So if you flip through pictures quickly, you won't necessarily see them in their full glory, unless you allow it a second to fill in the detail.  This is true even with the default sample photos on the Infinity.  I believe my Prime (when I had it) did the exact same thing.  No worries to me.  I think when I viewed the photos on an iPad 2, they showed up straight away without having to redraw the details like that.  I will check later tho about the iPad 2.  I don't know anyone with the New iPad to compare there.And can anyone else download the Starlight Live Wallpaper Free version and let me know if it is all screwed up now?  I think it has to do with the wallpapers showing the full image and remaining static vs. scrolling side to side as you swipe the main screens left and right.  I really hope this gets an option to switch to either option in the Jellybean OS update, which JB has been confirmed for this tablet with no set release date as of yet.****Update 7/22/12:  So while typing on Amazon comments, I had some weird glitches happening where the cursor would jump suddenly to another part of the text field and it really was annoying.  I will try another virtual keyboard other than the default one that I'm currently using.****Update:  I forgot to mention the charge time for the tablet.  I charged it fully as recommended before using it initially.  Then I let it run down to 1%.  I timed it to see how long it would take to fully charge back to 100%.  Time taken was 2 hours and 5 minutes.  This is just the tablet, nothing to do with the docking keyboard.___________________________My initial review:  So after many months of waiting since returning my Asus Transformer Prime, I finally received my Infinity.  For the most part it looks similar, but there are some noticeable enhancements.  I'll start with my pros and cons and will only mention things that matter to me, and I may miss some things that you find important.  Just ask in the comments if you need any questions answered and I will do my best to get back to you.__________________________Pros:*I opted for the Amethyst Grey color this time around, and although I really like it, I think I prefer the Champagne Gold.  But regardless, both colors are very nice.  I don't think you can really go wrong either way.*The screen is very nice and higher resolution to the previous Prime.  I hear people complain about it being a fingerprint magnet, but I've used many tablets, and they ALL are fingerprint magnets.  Using a good stylus can help here, and the cloth that comes with it works perfectly for cleaning those nasty fingerprints.*Asus did not load too much bloatware, and the stuff they did preload is mostly useful.  Some people may not agree, but at least there aren't too many really large preloaded apps.*I got the 64 GB model, and that is plenty of storage, plus the MicroSD card slot adds to that, and the cloud storage.  We should be good to go for a while.*Sound is excellent for being a single speaker.  Using headphones sounds even better yet for music or games.*Power button is easier to use than the Prime, and the volume rocker is placed in a better location IMO.*So far apps have run smoothly.  I'm sure there will be glitches but none yet.*Web browsing is smooth so far also.  I'm using the default browser for now to test it out.*As most people know, it supports Flash.  This was important to me.*Both cameras were upgraded and are very nice.  I still have to play around more with it to get to know it better.*ICS OS runs pretty good.  This can get better if and when we get JB.*GPS locks on really quickly for me.  It took forever on my Prime when I had it, so this was nice to see that it works now.  In less than 5 seconds I have 5 satellites, then a few seconds later, I have 14 in view per GPS Test app.  And this is in my apartment on an overcast day.*WiFi Analyzer app shows that the antenna is working better this time around also.*Anything I bought previously on the Google Playstore shows purchased and ready for me to download again without buying again. Some people may not know that.________________Cons:*There can sometimes still be lag when scrolling, but nothing serious.  And I hear JB OS will help that out too.*I think there are plenty of apps, free or paid, available for Android, but some people may prefer the Apple store for iPad since they have \"more\" apps.  I do think Google Playstore should have a section exclusively for apps enhanced for tablets rather than having us rely on telling each other, or finding out for ourselves.  But so far, no problems.*Sometimes I feel like the tablet can dig into my hand when holding it and can be uncomfortable.  But it feels better than the Prime did due to the slight redesign.*Some random crashes here and there when closing the docked tablet to the keyboard when reopening it*Some random crashes while using the default browser. As well as some quirks while trying to click on data input fields on some websites and pulling down dropdown menus.*I noticed some slight stutter while playing back 720p videos out to my HDTV.  Very slight though._______________________________________________I have to say that I am impressed with this tablet, however I don't notice a HUGE difference in the screen, since I don't have the old Prime any longer to compare against it.  Yes it is very nice though.The redesign is very nice.  I prefer the location of the volume rocker and headphone jack, and I like how the edge isn't as beveled as the Prime, so the plugs aren't as exposed, and the MicroSD card doesn't stick out at all now.I have read some people's reviews complaining about the plastic strip and the power/volume buttons looking and feeling cheap.  I don't find this to be true.  It fixes the problems that the Prime had, and I think they did a great job redesigning it to blend well with the color.  It feels very solid to me.The one minor complaint that I had, which didn't change my rating, it that Amazon listed this as available for order and available for 2 day deliver, which they did not hold up to that quote.  I have Amazon Prime and should get the 2 day delivery, however, I ordered mine Monday morning and received it Friday afternoon.  According to my calculations, that is more than 2 days.  Come on Amazon.  Don't post what you can't deliver.Eagerly awaiting the availability of the keyboard dock.I will update my review as needed depending on my findings.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Living up to the hype???", "unixReviewTime": 1342828800, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2012"}

I can rate this case as a solid 100% buy, plus it comes in several different colors (my daughter wants the pink one), and I got the grey one which is a nice medium grey and looks as classy as it is functional.

The WiFi app \"WiVideo\" crashes endlessly on my iPhone 5, on my old iPhone 4 still running iOS 5 it's better, but it still has problems that prevent me from being able to use it as intended. Also on the WiFi front, UStream is hit or miss too. I've tried several times, half the time I start UStream the camera turn off after one minute having never sent a single frame of video (and NO my battery WAS fully charged and I was on my home WiFi with a full signal), the rest of the time it seems to work fine, but note that you CAN NOT record and stream at the same time, it's one or the other.The construction of the camera feels fine, it doesn't feel flimsy and the dual mounting points are a big plus. But, the four side buttons don't always register presses, and the screen has a limited viewing angle so you need to look at it straight on. Also, I've had a hard time getting the lens protector off, it snaps on and off of the camera and it doesn't come off easily, which is good on the one hand it won't fall off, but when water gets under it, it can be a pain.Video quality is big for me, and on that front the ADIXXION in my opinion is a disappointment. I shoot video for a living, so I know an action cam isn't going to look as good as my main camera, but, compared to my ContourHD 1080p from 2009 the ADIXXION doesn't look as good (I'd love to post a side by side comparison but my ContourHD bit the dust, hence the need for a new action cam). The image isn't as sharp, there are more compression artifacts in the video from the ADIXXION then the video from the ContourHD, the exposure control is a little slow but not bad, and on auto White Balance the color temperature isn't as nice as the presets. Overall the image lacks detail, tree bark, grass, and foliage in general just become a blur. Sound goes hand in hand with video and the microphone on the ADIXXION isn't great. Wind noise is a big problem and it has no wind cut feature, so if you are moving with some speed you'll just have the sound of wind recorded, and there is no microphone input.Overall the ADIXXION is a disappointment, it's built well, but the WiFi is flakey, and the video quality is subpar vs my old ContourHD and even my old iPhone 4 with its 720p video has more detail.

The looks, the price, and the ability for it to hold a lot of drives and full sized components. However, once it had everything together, it was pretty sad to see the temps. While idle, my GPU temps were in the mid 60s and my CPU temps were in the mid 50s. In hopes of dropping the temps, I removed the I/O shield and installed an additional 120MM Cooler Master fan in the available space on the opposite side of the drive cage and flipped the power supply over to draw any additional heat out. This did help a little, but not as much as I thought it might. Part of the problem with this case is the 120MM front intake fan is a bit weak and the front face plate blocks the majority of the air that's trying to be drawn in. Add to this, the fact that the bulkiness of the drive cage structure also blocks a great deal of air attempting to be drawn in. As for my motherboard (Asrock H67M-ITX), the connectors sit right in front of the side 80MM fan, this was doing nothing to help either. That fan is pretty weak also, so it probably wouldn't help much even if it wasn't obstructed.If you can deal with the higher temps, then you probably wont mind this because other than the things I've pointed out, this is a pretty decent case, especially at this price. I'm running an i5-2500K Sandy Bridge, 8GB Kingston RAM, 120GB Kingston Hyper X SSD, two 2TB Western Digital Blacks, an Nvidia GTX 480, Corsair 600 watt power supply and an Asus dvd burner. You might say, ah no wonder his temps are hot, he's running a GTX 480! No doubt that's a contributing factor, but I also had all of this inside of a Silverstone SG07 and my temps were 20+ degrees cooler across the board. There was a lot more thought put into the layout of that case, with the power supply being mounted in the front and a 180MM fan in the rear blowing down over the CPU/GPU pocket.

I've purchased two NZXT cases (without power supplies) in the last year and have been extremely happy with both of them. The quality standards over at NZXT are apparently very high, and it continues through with their power supply units as well.I was immediately impressed by the packaging... a nicely designed box that's well-packed to assure that it would take a LOT of damage to the box to affect the unit itself. I always take notice on how companies package their products and when they go the extra mile protecting their units with 1-1/4\" foam padding, I feel like there's a concern for quality beyond when the unit leaves their factory.My computer case is quite large, and allows for running all cables under the motherboard panel to reduce clutter. The problem with that is, I had a lot of trouble with my last power supply as the wires weren't long enough to be routed under the panel and then to their destinations. With the Hale82N power supply, I had no problems routing the wires... the cables fit perfectly where the last unit came up short. The only downside is, since the cables are longer, there's more bulk when it comes to the unused cables. Smaller cases may have space issues. My daughter's case is much smaller then mine, and the power supply sits at the top, right behind the drive bay... there's little room for extra cables, so I used a modular PSU so I could remove the cables that aren't needed. This power supply would fit, but it would require a lot of unpleasant 'stuffing' of cables rather then orderly cable management.The unit is also noticeably quieter then my last one. With dual video cards and four hard drives, my last PSU use to get louder under heavy gaming.

Load times can kill you if your playing on drives that have little cache and low RPM. Load times actually effect Frames Per Second in games and applications. If the textures don't load quick enough into the video ram your FPS take a hit and the game(s) run poorly.Someone mentioned you could not use these in laptops, and to that person I say, if you have room in the system and are able to plug in the Readycache then why not? The statement just makes no sense, plus I found several people running benchmarks using laptops as an example, it cut their boot times in half.Bottom line, if you have 10K RPM drives with SSD or other caching solution Readycache won't help much. However if you have a 7200RPM drive or those horrible hybrid or energy star 5200-5400RPM drives then you will see a fantastic performance increase with everything from boot times cut in half to games loading and running more efficiently, and it only uses 0.5Watts while in use, and 0.05watts idle.My level of expertise?

When the CrashPlan backup engine isn't actively backing up, I'm seeing between 2% and 10% CPU utilization and right at 40% RAM utilization (because Java continues to be running in the background).  This little box plowed right on through until all the data was backed up to the cloud.Odd thing happened last night with about 8 GB left to backup, though.  I kept getting the error when launching CrashPlan desktop that it couldn't connect to the backup engine.  I launched the DSM web interface and sure enough, the CrashPlan package wasn't running.  It hasn't stopped on its own before.  All it took was one click to start the service again, and it's run just fine since then.  One thing I noticed is that the desktop application has been upgraded from 3.2.1 to 3.4.1 in the past 18-24 hours.  I don't think upgrading the desktop app would've required doing anything to the headless Linux install on the Synology, but maybe the two things are related.  I'll update again if the problem continues to occur.VPN server functionality continues to work well.  I did have to change DDNS providers because the service I was using (No-IP) apparently didn't recognize the Synology was actively using the service even though the Synology was successfully registering itself every 24 hours.  I got an e-mail from No-IP stating that I had to click a link every 30 days to keep my DDNS hostname active.  Either that, or pay a small yearly fee to avoid the hassle.  No thanks.  I've changed to Synology's DDNS service and it seems to be working just fine as far as DDNS resolution is concerned.  I've disabled the \"Heartbeat\" function for now, though.  Heartbeat seems like a cool feature because it will send you an e-mail when your Synology goes offline and when it comes back online.  It seemed to work for the first few hours I was using it.  Then, I got an e-mail stating that my Synology had gone offline.  However, I was still able to access it through my Synology DDNS address,  About 12 hours later, I got an e-mail that the box had come back online.  I may try the Heartbeat feature again in the future, but for now I'll leave it turned off.Update (Almost two weeks after receiving the product):The DS213 has been humming along now for almost two full weeks.  I continue to think this is the best purchase I've made this year for my home network.Time Machine backups continue to work flawlessly for both my and my wife's MacBook Pros.  My CrashPlan backup to CrashPlan Central is still running and shows about 10 days left before it's done backing up the full 510+ GB of data to the cloud.  I'm happy to report that if a CrashPlan backup gets interrupted during a power failure (I intentionally pulled the plug), once the power comes back on, the CrashPlan service starts automatically and the backup picks up right where it left off without any user intervention required.On the subject of CrashPlan backups, I would recommend that you purchase a Synology with 512 MB of RAM as a minimum if you plan on using CrashPlan much at all.  This DS213 has 512 MB of RAM.  Java (which is required to be installed on the Synology for CrashPlan to run) is a RAM hog.  According to the Resource Monitor in DSM, my DS213 is averaging anywhere between 50-85% RAM usage when the CrashPlan service (and therefore Java) is running.  I can't imagine trying to use CrashPlan on a Synology that only has 256 MB of RAM onboard.  Folks are saying they've been able to get it to work on Synologys with 256 MB of RAM; but I have to believe that a Synology with 256 MB of RAM takes a hit in terms of multi-tasking when the CrashPlan service is running.I've transitioned my main 1.5 TB external drive to the DS213, so I now have two external USB drives connected.  I set up a local backup in DSM so that every morning at 5 AM, the main contents of the internal 3 TB drive are backed up to the 1.5 TB external drive.  I'm happy to report that, unlike some of the reports I've seen online, using the \"Backup and Restore\" feature that's built in to DSM is doing incremental backups for me.  I'd seen conflicting reports online that using \"Backup and Restore\" caused the entire backup to be done from scratch each time.  This clearly isn't the case for me because the first backup took about five hours and each successive daily backup has taken 5-10 minutes tops.  So, the Synology is clearly examining what's already been copied, comparing it to what's on the internal drive, and only copying what's new or changed on the internal drive.I can't say enough good things about this device so far.  In every respect, it has met or exceeded my expectations.  The VPN server continues to work flawlessly and has allowed me to mount my home network shares and access the DSM web interface while on the road.  The device continues to remain in sync with my DDNS account without any issues.  All-in-all, I continue to be extremely satisfied with this purchase.Original review (October 2012):I will begin my review with a caveat -- I've only used this product for three days.  I can't speak to the reliability of the product yet, but I can share my initial impressions.For the past three days, I've been continually amazed at what this little box can do.  I paired it with aWestern Digital 3 TB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Bare or OEM Drives WD30EFRXand it's working exceptionally well.  It took less than five minutes to unbox the Synology, unbox the Western Digital hard drive, and install the drive into the Synology.When you first power on the Synology, it's just a dumb box (literally.)  You'll need to either go to the Synology website and download the Synology Assistant and the DSM (DiskStation Manager) OS or insert the included CD and install the Synology Assistant and the DSM OS from there.  Actually, I think maybe the CD just has the Synology Assistant and if you insert the CD, you still download the OS from the web, but I'm not sure about that.  I opted to download the Synology Assistant and the OS directly from the Synology site so I was sure to be installing the latest versions of both.It took about 15 minutes for the DiskStation OS to install on the box.  Once that was done, the process of \"initializing\" and formatting my 3 TB drive began.  That took about 8 hours.  While the Synology is busy initializing the drive, you can create user accounts and modify network settings (i.e. assign a static IP or configure DDNS), but you can't create any folders (or shares) or download any packages from the Package Center.  Just set up the Synology an hour or two before you go to bed and let it initialize the drive(s) while you're asleep.  That's my recommendation.While the hard drive was initializing, I took the opportunity to get the Synology registered with DDNS so if my IP address changes, I'll still be able to access it remotely.  It took less than five minutes to get this box added to my existing DDNS account.Once the drive was initialized and I could download packages, I set up the Synology box as a VPN server so I can mount the shares on this drive locally anywhere in the world.  That took all of a minute and a half including the time it took to download the VPN Server package from the Package Center.I've transferred the contents of my primary external drive (~500 GB) to the Synology.  Worked flawlessly.  Last night, I installed CrashPlan on the Synology so I can have its contents continually backed up off-site.  I had to follow some instructions to get CrashPlan working (it's not a one-click install), but the third-party support for the Synology platform is impressive.I plugged in one of my external 1 TB hard drives.  It took about 15 minutes for the Synology to format it to ext4 format.  Once that was done, the drive showed up in DSM, and I was able to share it out to specific users and use it as a local backup destination for the 3 TB drive inside the Synology.  Once the CrashPlan backup of the internal Synology drive is complete, I will format my main 1.5 TB external drive as ext4 and also attach it to the Synology.  That will bring my effective network storage up to nearly 5.5 TB.  Pretty impressive.I'm ashamed to say that a couple of years ago, I purchased aPogoplug Multimedia Sharing Device.  I was hoping at the time that the Pogoplug would be a reliable NAS-type device that would allow me to access my files from anywhere and easily share files with family and friends.  This device runs circles around the Pogoplug, and it's silly to even mention the two products in the same sentence.  Of course, the Pogoplug is $30 and this Synology box is $300 as of the writing of this review.  Sure, those prices are nowhere near in the same ballpark, but in this instance, I truly believe you get what you pay for.  You can read my detailed review of the Pogoplug here on Amazon, as well.Unlike the Pogoplug, the Synology works as a destination for Time Machine backups.  One word of caution: set up a unique account for Time Machine backups (or multiple accounts if you'll be backing up multiple computers via Time Machine).  Then, be sure to enable disk quotas on the Time Machine account(s).  This will set a threshold for how much space Time Machine is allowed to use for backups.  Otherwise, Time Machine will gladly eat up all the space on your NAS.  My wife and I are both backing our MacBook Pros up to the Synology and I created a Time Machine account for each of our computers.  I gave both Time Machine user accounts a quota of 250 GB.  So far, Time Machine backups are working flawlessly on both of our computers (she's using Snow Leopard and I'm using Mountain Lion.)On the subject of noise, the Synology box is dead quiet.  I've had it on 24/7 since plugging it in three days ago and it's quiet and running cool.  The OS is highly configurable and if you want, you can set it up so that the Synology will power off and power on at specified times every day.  I'll probably just leave mine on all the time.  I was happy to see the option in the OS for the Synology to automatically restart in the event of a power outage once power is restored.  I don't currently have it connected to a UPS, so if the power flickers or goes out, I'm glad to know that the box will automatically power back on once power comes back on.  Don't get me started on how much of a nightmare the Pogoplug was if, God forbid, the power went out.  I tested the Synology by purposely pulling the plug.  When I plugged it back in, the box booted up and it was ready for use again in about three minutes.I will continue to update this review (as I did with the Pogoplug) if my experience with the Synology box changes over the coming weeks and months.  So far, though, color me impressed!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easily the best purchase I've made for my network recently", "unixReviewTime": 1350259200, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2012"}

I have 3 now and each was a different style, but all have been very high quality.EXTERIOR: The patterns and textures are accurate. Even from up close, it looks exactly like a fresh composition notebook. The difference is in the actual material. Whatever is underneath the skin is stiff, but compliant. I've said it before and I still believe it may be Kydex or something similar. The skin has a hard matte texture. The spine has the same cloth-tape look and feel as the original.

However, on this Verso cover, the inside looks like college-ruled notebook paper. The texture is the same suede-like material as other Verso covers.

Insignia is one of the very few companies that include HD in their tuners. This is the best HD radio I've seen. It's compact, takes four AA's and is very selective and sensitive in receiving signals.

I look forward to bringing this radio with me on the road to see what I can pick up.This radio also has an RDS feature that displays the call letters and the song that is currently playing on stations that do have that feature. Only other portable that has this is Sangeans PR D5. Now, if that radio had HD capabilities, that would make that model the tops in it's field.Finally, an easy, convenient way to listen to HD radio.

Otherwise, unless \"Pointer Speed\" is set really slow, there can be far too much jerkiness and lack of precision compared to using a mouse.&#4335; There is no right-click-n-drag gesture available on this touchpad, which is needed to effectively use Microsoft Excel, graphics/photo programs, Windows Explorer, and other applications.&#4335; Because of the above two drawbacks, this touchpad cannot be efficiently used with Microsoft Excel, photo/graphics editing programs, or other applications requiring either right-click-n-drag or very precise pointer positioning/dragging/clicking. Hopefully, an enhancement to a later version of SetPoint can fix this?&#4335; When used with Windows 8, swiping the touchpad's top and side edges perform Windows 8 functions. But when used with Windows 7, the touchpad's outer edges have a half-inch wide \"dead zone\" perimeter where nothing happens.&#4335; The two left/right rubber feet buttons underneath the touchpad at the bottom left/right corners really would be more ergonomic, adaptable, and durable if they were located as buttons on top of the touchpad, instead of being clicked by pressing onto the rubber feet.&#4335; This touchpad has no moving parts and should last a very long time, but its rechargeable proprietary lithium ion polymer battery is not user-replaceable (and Logitech does not offer a service to replace it).&#4335; Small nitpick, but I would have preferred a Bluetooth version of this touchpad, especially since I use this touchpad with Logitech's K810 Bluetooth keyboard, so there would be no need to plug in a USB receiver.What is in the box package?&#10037; Touchpad T650&#10037; USB \"Unifying\" nano-receiver that can be paired with up to six Logitech devices simultaneously&#10037; 6-foot USB-to-Micro-USB recharging cable wound around two plastic cable clip guides to keep it organized&#10037; 10-page English-language \"Setup Guide\"With the release of Windows 8, Microsoft altered the Windows user interface to accommodate tablets and smartphones, welcoming in the new era of Windows touch-oriented computing. But by doing so, Microsoft also drove countless users of regular Windows computers crazy, forcing the mouse-oriented computing world to live by the rules of the touch-oriented world. This touchpad is essentially like the touchpad on your laptop, but with a surface area at least 50% larger than even the biggest laptop trackpad and enhanced to understand all of the common finger gestures that are now used on touchscreens and, in particular, Windows 8 gesture commands. Note that this touchpad is still just a pointing device, like using an oversized laptop touchpad that is enhanced with Windows 8 gestures. If you want a more-intuitive where-you-touch-is-where-your-cursor-moves-on-the-screen Windows 8 experience, you need to get a Windows 8 tablet or computer that is equipped with a touchscreen, in which case you would not need this T650 Touchpad. So adding this T650 to a Windows 8 computer not equipped with a touchscreen is not quite the same as using a Windows 8 touchscreen.One thing should be clarified regarding this touchpad's compatibility with Windows versions. Logitech states that this touchpad only works with Windows 8, Windows RT, or Windows 7. But I have confirmed that this touchpad works very well with Windows Vista; on my 32-bit Windows Vista (Service Pack 2), both the hardware and the SetPoint software are working perfectly. I have been using this touchpad for the past two weeks with 64-bit Windows 8, 64-bit Windows 7, 32-bit Windows 7, and 32-bit Windows Vista (Service Pack 2), and it works flawlessly with all of them. This touchpad's operation on Windows Vista is nearly identical to its functionality on Windows 7. I itemize this touchpad's behavioral differences between Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista later in this review.More of this Logitech Rechargeable Touchpad T650's notable product features are described and rated below:&#9658; Packaging, Style, Appearance: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Excellent 5-fuzzies rating&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; This rechargeable touchpad charges using a USB-to-Micro-USB cable that is included in the box package. The supplied 6-foot cable is wound around two plastic cable clip guides that keep the cable neat and tidy. Most electronic manufacturers do not include cable guides/clips to neatly store their cables, so this is a nice touch by Logitech.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; The touchpad is sleek and stylish with a gray-colored glass surface that complements the gray/black color theme present on all of Logitech's other mice and keyboards. I am using this touchpad with Logitech's excellent newLogitech Bluetooth Illuminated Keyboard K810 for PCs, Tablets, Smartphones - Black  (920-004292), and it is obvious that both products were designed at the same time to work together because the touchpad matches the style of the K810 keyboard. Both have a similar gray color, similar depth measurement, slim sleek profile with similar low heights, and similar rounding of their four corners. This touchpad looks very nice placed next to the K810 keyboard.This touchpad's measurements are:Width: 5.3 inchesDepth/Length: 5.1 inchesHeight: 0.34 inch front, 0.47 inch rearWeight: 7.3 ounces&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; The touchpad's glass surface feels smooth, just like a touching a touchscreen display, but without being too slippery. The glass feels like it has been lightly sandblasted to give your fingers a bit of traction and tactile feedback. The glass feels durable, scratch-resistant, and also smudge-resistant, which is nice because my fingers are constantly tapping and swiping all over its surface. If you use this touchpad in a cold room such as a data center or office with turbocharged air conditioning, the glass will feel cold to the touch.&#9658; Construction & Build Quality: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Excellent 5-fuzzies rating&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; As with the matching K810 keyboard, this touchpad has excellent build quality. The glass surface mounted on top, all seams, and the bottom panel are all precisely and tightly fitted with no exposed screws. The four corners underneath the touchpad have four small rubber feet for traction. The two lower left/right rubber feet also function as buttons; they press into the interior of the touchpad with a slight clicking sound when you press on the lower left/right corners of the touchpad. The right side of the touchpad has a sliding power switch, and the rear edge has the Micro-USB port for the recharging cable.&#9658; Installation & Setup: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Excellent 5-fuzzies rating&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; A 10-page \"Setup Guide\" is included. This touchpad is easy to set up. I just plug in the USB receiver, and slide the power switch on the right edge of the touchpad to turn it on. When the touchpad is first turned on or when it wakes up from standby/sleep mode, a small battery status LED light in its upper right corner will temporarily glow green if the battery has power, or it will light up red if the battery needs to be charged through a USB port. While its USB cord is plugged in to recharge the internal battery, the LED light blinks green. After two to three hours of charging time, the battery status light turns off. I can continue to use the touchpad while it is plugged in for recharging. The battery status light normally is unlit and stays hidden. The touchpad that I purchased already had power in its battery. Logitech states that a full two to three hour recharge of this touchpad will provide up to one month of power.There is no software included with this touchpad, and no drivers need to be installed to use it. As with all of Logitech's keyboards and mice, you can download their SetPoint software from Logitech's Web site which will allow you to customize this touchpad's functions. When you turn on the touchpad, it would prompt you to download and install SetPoint. If the automatic download does not happen, the \"Setup Guide\" lists the URL Web address where you go to manually download the latest SetPoint software. With most of Logitech's keyboard and mice, using their SetPoint is optional. But with this touchpad, I think that installing SetPoint on your Windows computer really enhances, customizes, and tutors your touchpad usage. I talk about how SetPoint interacts with this touchpad later in this review.When downloading the SetPoint software from Logitech's Web site, the download section only lists \"Windows 7\" and \"Windows 8\" versions of SetPoint. But I have confirmed that the \"Windows 7\" version of SetPoint can also be used on Windows Vista.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; This touchpad utilizes Logitech's USB 2.0-protocol 'Unifying Receiver' that can interact with up to six Unifying-compatible Logitech keyboards, mice, or number pads, and it has a wireless range up to 33 feet. However, there is no place to store this small thumbnail-sized USB nano-receiver unless I leave it always plugged into a USB port. On some of Logitech's mice and number pad models, there is a storage slot on the device that securely stores its USB receiver. But there is no way to store this touchpad's USB nano-receiver on the body of the touchpad itself, and if the nano-receiver is stored and carried separately, its tiny size increases the risk of losing it. The rear edge of the touchpad seems thick enough that a USB receiver storage slot could have been molded into it, or have a molded inset underneath the touchpad where the USB nano-receiver could be stored when it is not in use. If I want to transport the touchpad with its USB nano-receiver unplugged, I have to place it inside a pouch that ensures the tiny device does not get lost.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; I wish that Logitech also offered a Bluetooth version of this touchpad. I would have purchased a Bluetooth version of this T650 Touchpad if it was available. I use this touchpad with the awesome newly-released Logitech Bluetooth Illuminated Keyboard K810. Logitech's K810 Bluetooth keyboard has a unique and very useful \"Easy-Switch\" feature that lets it pair with up to three Bluetooth-enabled devices. Since this touchpad works so well with the K810 keyboard, what would be really cool is if a Bluetooth T650 Touchpad was made that had three buttons on the front edge of the touchpad that, when pressed, could also quickly switch to one of three Bluetooth devices, which is what the K810 keyboard can do. And since the gestures and movements are nearly identical when using this touchpad between different versions of Windows, its use would be effortless when hopping back and forth between three different Windows computers.&#9658; Design & Features: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Excellent 5-fuzzies rating&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; The following lists the full set of clicking gestures, navigation gestures, and window movement gestures that are available for Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista. Logitech does not include Windows Vista in its compatibility list for this touchpad, but I have confirmed that the touchpad gestures listed below work great with Windows Vista.For the gestures listed below that have multiple listings, the first listing is the default operation for that gesture and the other listed methods can be used by customizing them using the Logitech SetPoint software. For the actions that involve a \"tap\", this means using the fingers to briefly tap on the glass surface. For actions that involve a \"click\", this means using one, two, or three fingers to press down on the surface with enough force to cause one of the two rubber feet buttons on the underside of the left and right corners to trigger a click. The force that is required to press down on the surface for \"click\" actions is slightly harder/firmer than the left/right button clicks on a mouse. Logitech's SetPoint software is very flexible in letting me customize gestures so they only involve tapping, only involve clicking, or can involve either of the two actions. I have my SetPoint configured so that I never have to press down to perform clicks at all; all of my gestures are configured to only involve either taps or swipes.Left Click (Windows 8/7/Vista):1) Click and/or tap with 1 finger.Left Click and Drag (Windows 8/7/Vista):1) Move pointer into position with index finger, press and hold down either the left or right corner button using another finger while moving index finger to drag the pointer.2) Double-tap with 1 finger. On the second tap, do not raise the finger, but keep it in contact with the touchpad and move it to drag.(Both left-click-n-drag options may be used interchangeably without needing to just solely use one or the other. The second \"Double-tap with 1 finger\" gesture requires SetPoint version 6.51.8 or later.)Right Click (Windows 8/7/Vista):1) Tap and/or click in lower right corner with 1 finger.2) Tap and/or click in lower left corner with 1 finger.3) Click and/or tap with 2 fingers.Middle Click (Windows 8/7/Vista):1) Click and/or tap with 3 fingers.Vertical Scrolling (Windows 8/7/Vista):1) Swipe up or down with 2 fingers.Horizontal Scrolling (Windows 8/7/Vista):1) Swipe left or right with 2 fingers.Back/Forward (Windows 8/7/Vista):1) Swipe left or right with 3 fingers.Zoom In/Out (Windows 8/7/Vista):1) Spread or pinch with 2 fingers.Go to Windows 8 Start Screen (Windows 8):1) Swipe 3 fingers up.orSwitch Applications (Windows 7/Vista):1) Swipe 3 fingers up.Show/Hide Desktop (Windows 8/7/Vista):1) Swipe 3 fingers down.Maximize/Minimize Desktop Windows (Windows 8/7/Vista):1) Swipe 4 fingers up or down.Snap Windows Left or Right (Windows 8/7; not available in Windows Vista):1) Swipe 4 fingers left or right.Switch Applications in Windows 8 (not available in Windows 7/Vista):1) Swipe 1 finger right from left edge of touchpad.Open/Close Charms sidebar in Windows 8 (not available in Windows 7/Vista):1) Swipe 1 finger left from right edge of touchpad.Open/Close Application Menu in Windows 8 (not available in Windows 7/Vista):1) Swipe 1 finger downward starting from top edge of touchpad.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; From the above listing, if you compare which gestures work with which Windows versions, it is easy to memorize. Windows Vista works identical to Windows 7 except for the swipe-4-fingers-left/right \"Snap Windows\" gesture since Windows Vista does not have snap functionality, neither Windows 7 nor Windows Vista work with the three 1-finger swiping actions from the left/right/top edge of the touchpad, and neither Windows 7 nor Vista use the Windows 8-specific swipe-3-fingers-up \"Go to Windows 8 Start Screen\" gesture. Other than those five differences, the other ten gestures work exactly the same regardless of whether you use this touchpad with Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista.Here is a tip if you are having trouble getting consistent use of the 2-finger, 3-finger, and 4-finger tapping or swiping gestures: Keep the fingers level and pressed side-by-side with each other, without having some fingers slightly tipping upward and other fingers slightly tipping downward. Do not use the very tips of your fingers near the fingernails for multi-finger gestures. Using the very tip of the finger is fine for 1-finger gestures. But for multi-finger gestures, pretend that the touchpad needs to fully scan all the fingerprints of those fingers as you swipe or tap them on the touchpad's surface.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; The zooming gesture of spreading and pinching with two fingers is not quite as smooth and fluid as when I zoom on Apple's Magic Trackpad. But the other gestures work very well and I think it is comparable to Apple's trackpad for fluidity and ease of operation.&#1150;&#1150; Note that the above list has no \"Right Click and Drag\" gesture available! Using Excel, I cannot move the pointer right onto the border of a spreadsheet cell, right-click-n-drag, and get the usual \"Move Here / Copy Here / Shift Down and Copy ...\" dropdown menu, and I cannot right-click-n-drag on the lower right corner of a cell to get the \"Copy Cells\" dropdown menu. The touchpad only supports left-click-n-drag, not right-click-n-drag. This is one of the two reasons that this touchpad will not fully replace my mouse. There are various other applications, including Windows Explorer and many graphics/photo editing software, that also utilize right-click-n-drag to perform operations and selection functions. For example, I also use a Firefox add-on that lets me right-click-n-drag to highlight a section of a Web page and then I can simultaneously open all the links within that highlighted box. But to not be able to perform right-click-n-drag on Excel, Windows Explorer, or graphics software may be a deal-breaker for people who frequently use these applications. I use Excel on a monthly basis and must still use my mouse for Excel. I wish that this can be fixed with an enhancement to a later version of SetPoint. Apple's Magic Trackpad also does not have a right-click-n-drag operation.Prior to SetPoint version 6.51.8, left-click-n-drag could only be accomplished by moving the pointer into position with an index finger, and then pressing and holding down either the left or right corner button using another finger while moving index finger to drag the pointer. With SetPoint version 6.51.8 and later, I can now use the easier method of double-tapping with one finger, and on the second tap, I keep the finger pressed onto the touchpad and move it to drag.So now that the new SetPoint version 6.51.8 lets me left-click-n-drag using 1-finger-double-tap-n-drag, the issue with lacking a right-click-n-drag gesture could be fixed if SetPoint was enhanced to allow right-click-n-drag to be operated using a 2-finger-double-tap-n-drag movement. I already have my SetPoint configured so that the primary left click is \"Click or tap with 1 finger\", right click is \"Click or tap with 2 fingers\", and middle click is \"Click or tap with 3 fingers\". So adding a new 2-finger-double-tap-n-drag option to SetPoint to perform the right-click-n-drag would be a very intuitive gesture based on this 1/2/3-finger left/right/middle approach.&#9658; Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Good 4-fuzzies rating&#1150;&#1150; When this touchpad is used with Windows 8, swiping the top and side edges perform Windows 8 functions. But when used with Windows 7 (or Vista), the touchpad's outer edges have a half-inch wide \"dead zone\" perimeter where nothing happens. Ideally, the touchpad, or SetPoint, should be adaptive enough to realize that it is being used with Windows 7, and since the three edge-swiping gestures do not apply, it should make this \"dead zone\" fully usable for all the other gesture movements. I am a touch typist who rarely looks down at the keyboard, and since I often use this touchpad with Logitech's new backlit K810 keyboard in a dark room, when using this touchpad with Windows 7, I sometimes notice that my pointer movement or navigation gesture stops working, and I realize that my finger has drifted over into this \"dead zone\". This can be annoying at times.&#1150;&#1150; Along with using one, two, three, or four fingers on the touchpad for gestures, the bottom left and right corners of the touchpad can also function as buttons. The two small rubber feet at the bottom two corners of this touchpad can be optionally configured to activate the 'Left Click' and 'Right Click' functions. They are basically like inverted mouse buttons placed underneath this touchpad. I wish that Logitech had designed these two buttons to be placed on top of the trackpad near the bottom left/right corners instead of being activated by pressing onto the trackpad's surface, which causes the rubber feet to click into the interior of the trackpad. I think that these two rubber feet buttons have three weaknesses in their design with respect to ergonomics, flexibility of usage, and durability.The ergonomics of these two rubber feet buttons are not that good for a touch typist who stares at the screen without looking down at the keyboard or touchpad while typing. Because the entire touchpad is smooth and flat on its surface, there is room for error when quickly reaching my thumb or pinky to click on the bottom corners because my hand may be sliding and swiping all over the touchpad. If the two buttons were made as slightly raised circular rounded buttons located near the bottom left/right corners, that would provide positive tactile feedback to my clicking finger regardless of where my other fingers may be sliding or swiping.By having the two rubber feet serve as buttons, this touchpad also loses flexibility in its positioning. I have to always place this touchpad on a flat surface. If the buttons were located on top, I could still reliably use this touchpad while it is placed on my lap, on a sofa/chair cushion next to me, on a bed mattress, or on a carpet. But I cannot activate these rubber feet buttons if the touchpad is placed on an irregular surface unless I find a book or flat item to place underneath it.I also have concerns about the long-term durability of repeatedly pressing on these two rubber feet buttons. All four rubber feet at the four corners underneath the touchpad are tiny, about 0.2\" in diameter and 0.05\" high. They are also not that firm, about as soft as a pencil's eraser. Either from the user repeatedly pressing down onto the bottom two clicking feet, or from the touchpad being slid along the desktop over time, these small soft rubber feet could be worn down over time so that they are level with the bottom surface of the touchpad and they would no longer activate the clicking action. These two rubber clicking feet should have been made larger in diameter and/or with more of the two feets' height protruding from the bottom for better long-term durability.Luckily, I can configure SetPoint to never need a reason to click either of the two rubber feet buttons. By default, the right-click action is performed by tapping or clicking the lower right corner with 1 finger. But I used SetPoint to configure right-click to be \"Click or tap with 2 fingers\". Using that in conjunction with \"Click or tap with 1 finger\" for left-click and \"Click or tap with 3 fingers\" for middle-click is very intuitive, and there is less hand/wrist/finger movement required when compared to reaching for the lower right corner. With right-click configured for \"Click or tap with 2 fingers\", both the left and right corner buttons perform the same left-click action as \"Click or tap with 1 finger\". But because SetPoint version 6.51.8 now lets me double-tap-with-1-finger-n-drag for my left-click-n-drag motion, I can always ignore those two rubber feet buttons, and I can now use my touchpad placed on my lap or any irregular surface :-)&#9658; Performance, Durability, Reliability: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Excellent 5-fuzzies rating&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Because of the solid build quality of this touchpad and the fact that it has no moving parts except for the two rubber feet buttons, I expect it to last a very long time.This touchpad uses a Li-Pol rechargeable battery is not user-replaceable. Logitech does not specify how long this battery can last or how many times it can be recharged. Most lithium-ion polymer batteries initially recharge using a so-called \"fast charge\" method and then switch to a \"trickle charge\" method as the battery voltage reaches its maximum. But the battery's maximum capacity is diminished slightly with every recharging back to full voltage. In the \"Setup Guide\" for this touchpad, there is a \"Battery disposal\" section with instructions on how to unscrew the bottom of the touchpad and remove the internal lithium-ion battery in order to properly dispose of the battery. This touchpad has no moving parts and will likely have a much longer lifespan than a keyboard. As with all lithium-ion batteries, this touchpad's battery will eventually not be able to hold a charge, and instead of being able to replace the battery myself or even be able to send the touchpad to Logitech for them to replace the battery, I am then left with a non-rechargeable device that I presume I can then still at least continue to use by keeping the touchpad always plugged into a USB port, thereby permanently making this a wired device. Using rechargeable batteries in a wireless device is more environmentally responsible than using disposable batteries, but being able to replace that rechargeable battery is far better. Apple provides services to replace the rechargeable batteries in their products and they then properly recycle the old batteries. And Apple's Magic Trackpad uses two user-replaceable AA batteries. So I wish that this touchpad's battery could be replaced when it eventually wears out.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; This touchpad comes with a 3-year limited hardware warranty.&#9658; Logitech SetPoint Software Quality: &#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Good 4-fuzzies rating&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Logitech's SetPoint software lets you configure and customize their keyboards and mice. While the installation of SetPoint is usually optional, albeit recommended, for most of Logitech's keyboards and mice, when used with this touchpad, it really does improve your experience using this touchpad, both because of its numerous customization options, and because as you customize the various clicking, navigation, and window movement gestures on the \"SetPoint Settings\" window, it also repeatedly plays a quick video showing how to perform that gesture option which you have selected. Logitech also has these same gesture videos on their Web site, but to have all of them displayed from within SetPoint is really useful and convenient.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; If you already have an older version of SetPoint running on your Windows computer, you should update it to version 6.51.8 (or later) to ensure that it works with this new touchpad. SetPoint version 6.51.8 lets you accomplish left-click-n-drag using a 1-finger-double-tap-n-drag movement. With older versions of SetPoint, such as 6.50, you could only left-click-n-drag using a more cumbersome method of moving the pointer into position with an index finger, and then pressing and holding down either the left or right corner button using another finger while moving index finger to drag the pointer.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; From within SetPoint, I can launch Logitech's Unifying Software to pair up to six compatible Logitech keyboards, mice, number pads, and other peripherals so that they all use the same single USB receiver, so multiple Logitech Unifying-compatible devices share the same receiver to only use up one USB port.&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Along with customizing or being able to disable the various gestures I listed above, SetPoint lets me adjust \"Pointer Speed\". This is similar to the \"Pointer Speed\" slider option on mouse software. There are three scroll options that can be configured in SetPoint. The 'Speed Increment' setting lets me adjust the scrolling speed by line increments or by screen. Normally, scrolling moves the window's scroll bar in the same direction as my finger. But if I set the \"Synchronize scroll direction\" checkbox, the direction is reversed so that the page contents move in the same direction as my two fingers; this is analogous to a \"panning\" action. The convenient \"Scroll with inertia\" option lets me flick my two fingers across the touchpad to quickly scroll longer distances; this flicking action is used by most tablet and smartphone touchscreens.&#1150;&#1150; SetPoint lets me configure the touchpad's \"Pointer Speed\". But it really also needs to have a \"Pointer Acceleration\" or \"Enhanced Pointer Precision\" setting, implemented as a checkbox or slider option, that dynamically adjusts the sensitivity of the pointer based on its acceleration. The touchpad's pointer currently translates finger movements with more of a proportional linear tracking, but for using this touchpad with applications such as Microsoft Excel, photo/graphics programs, and other software that require a delicate high-precision low-sensitivity finesse of movement, adding a \"Pointer Acceleration\" setting would give me a nice balance between high-precision low-pointer-sensitivity movements, needed when my finger is moving slowly around cells within a spreadsheet or using the freehand drawing tool of a photo/graphics program, and quicker high-sensitivity movements of the pointer across the screen area for most other kinds of clicking and screen navigation movements. Having an adjustable \"Pointer Acceleration\" or \"Enhanced Pointer Precision\" feature would also improve the precision of just tapping to click on links or using the 1-finger-double-tap-n-drag to perform left-click-n-drag operations where I do not want the pointer to slightly shift while I tap. I have my \"Pointer Speed\" in SetPoint set to one notch faster than the middle setting, so it is not set very fast. But I sometimes have to repeat a 1-finger-double-tap-n-drag to perform left-click-n-drag because the pointer's position slightly shifted off a border that I was wanting to drag or off a letter in a word that I was wanting to drag for highlighting/selection purposes.NOTE: My review does NOT end here, but continues on the 'Comment' section of this review.

Danzig", "helpful": [6, 8], "reviewText": "I think I was too hard on this recorder in my initial review, so I have added one star and edited my comments to reflect my current appraisal of this machine.I have deducted one star out of five for two drawbacks.  First, the feature most highly touted -- the automatic recording mode suggested by the Voice Tracer name -- has at least one significant problem. While the recorder is making the adjustment -- which takes a few seconds -- it doesn't record anything.  This means you are going to lose a few seconds of a recording.Let's assume, for example, that you want to record a lecture.  You must begin the automatic setting procedure when someone is speaking; you can't take a sample of the quiet room.  If the speaker is someone introducing the main lecturer, you will lose a few seconds of that introduction.If there is no introduction, then you will lose a few seconds of the primary lecture.  In either event, you lose.It is unclear from the included PDF manual if Philips has incorporated Automatic Gain Control into this recorder -- a standard recording-level-setting feature which has been around for years.  At least that technology works on the fly, allowing instant level adjustments according to real-time conditions.You can, however, turn OFF the automatic setting function, instead adjusting the recorder for a particular situation, say recording a conversation or a lecture -- or you can record manually, setting the recording level according to a meter.Other features include a wind filter, noise reduction to help eliminate background noise, timer and voice-activated recording, an alarm clock or appointment reminder function, WMA and MP3 music playback and equalization, and more.The recorder offers a number of sampling rates, from PCM with no compression enabling 6 hours of recording, to LP that runs up to 1,140 hours.  Unfortunately the instructions don't give the frequency responses of these various \"speeds\", just the sampling rates, from 44.1kHz for PCM to 16kHz for LP.You can also plug in a microSD card for more recording capacity.Two NiMH rechargeable AAA batteries are included (which can be charged in the recorder from your computer using the short USB cable provided), enabling battery life of up to 42 hours of recording using the internal memory or 16 hours using a memory card.The second drawback for which I have deducted one star is the poor-quality built-in speaker.  It introduces a fair amount of distortion into the playback, which I had initially assumed was resident in the recording itself.  Not so -- I connected the recorder to my computer and discovered that the distortion had come from the speaker, not the recording level.So I will give this recorder a provisional thumbs-up, assuming that you use it with a computer or headphones to provide distortion-free playback.PROS:* Attractive design.* Good value for the money.* Stereo mikes built in.* Ample built-in memory storage.* Sufficient battery life.* Rechargeable NiMH batteries included.* Many useful features.CONS:* Automatic recording setting feature cuts out audio for several seconds.* Poor quality built-in speaker.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Decent Digital Voice Recorder with Two Minor Drawbacks", "unixReviewTime": 1356912000, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2012"}

What?!)The coolest feature is, obviously, being able to focus after the fact.  The sensitivity is very poor, so that rules out action shots, and therefore the time saved from not having to focus really isn't relevant.  Regardless of the post-capture focusing, the camera still does need to perform a pre-capture coarse focus so that the focal depth is at least reasonably close to the subject.  If it matters to you, it's pretty quick.If you want to imagine what the camera is really capturing, it is analogous to taking many identical pictures while changing your manual focus - this camera does it all simultaneously.  By analyzing what is blurry or focused in each image, the software is able to determine how far away each object is, which allows for rudimentary 3D-space computation, such as the perspective shift and depth-based image effects.The zoom feature is nearly impossible to use - I haven't figured out the trick to get the touchscreen to handle it reliably.The PC software is quite oversimplified, but it lets you fiddle with focus and various depth-related filters.  While these filters definitely can improve your photo, it's far from the kind of filtering you can get even from cheap Photoshop knock offs.  And then, it makes it easy to post to Facebook, but I can't find any kind of \"save this picture\" menu item.  It seems easier to capture a screenshot.After all of the above, your final Lytro pictures are the low-quality equivalent of photos taken with any other camera.If the camera is good for anything, it would be its ability to perform focus stacking, where multiple focal depths are combined to form an image that is not just perfectly focused, but focused on everything in the scene simultaneously - something that is impossible to do optically.  This is almost never relevant; the quality is too low for professional photographers, but perhaps people who need the macro feature would be able to get everything in the shot fully focused.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "One trick pony", "unixReviewTime": 1354752000, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2012"}

Not being able to get one's favorite case is part of being an early adopter--it goes with the territory.-----14 Feb 2013 UPDATEOver time, this case was a hassle and a headache. The on/off upper-right button was hard to find. The bottom-center button was hard to find. I did go ahead and get theAmzer Soft Silicone Jelly Skin Fit Case Cover for Apple iPad Mini - Green (AMZ94586), which I much prefer. I use several of this Anzer silicone product-line (one for each device), and see no reason to not use it the iPad Mini.I have to warn you, once the i-Blason case is on the iPad Mini, it's nearly impossible to remove--we had a heck of a time getting it off the iPad Mini (my hubbie cut himself with a letter-opener, where we finally pried the case open using three miniature screwdrivers simultaneously).A suede zipper case that fits the iPad Mini with either this i-Blason or the Amzer, after looking over several hundred case descriptions is (drum roll):Green Trim SumacLife Micro Suede Protective Sleeve Cover with Neoprene Bubble Padding for Motorola Droid Xyboard 8.2 inch Android Tablet(in lots of different colors). The SumacLife is about 1/2\" bigger across and 1/2\" bigger down, and plenty thick.For a stand, I use theArkon Portable Fold-Up Stand for Apple iPad, Galaxy Tab, Kindle Fire, Playbook, Xoom, Toshiba, Acer, Nook and Other Tablets (IPM-TAB1).

{"reviewerID": "A3L1RIEAPX26O2", "asin": "B009F1I1C4", "reviewerName": "E. Carbone", "helpful": [11, 12], "reviewText": "I purchased this model a couple of weeks ago. I have purchased four Asus netbooks since 2007 and I still have all but the first one I bought (which was still running fine but had become obsolete in many ways, so I donated it).  So as you can tell, I was a big fan of Asus netbooks.  While the netbook era seems to have ended, I still wanted something that was a lot like a netbook: Highly portable, lightweight, sufficiently powerful to do most anything I need to do on a laptop, highly affordable, and durable enough to be taken on airplanes, to coffee shops, or wherever.This new Asus does the trick!Positives:First of all, at approximately $500, you are going to have difficulty finding this overall set of features and performance in a very small footprint laptop - period.  Now if you want to spend $1000 or more, you will get a more upscale set of components elsewhere (including the Asus Zenbook offerings). The question is whether you need or will even notice the better performance. But assuming you like the notion of a modest, $500 investment, the Q200E is very worthy of consideration.The upsides of the Q200E: Very thin profile, weighs less than 3 lbs, nicely responsive 11.6 inch touch screen, runs Windows 8 and applications swiftly, starts up fast (like most of the \"ultrabooks\"), solidly built with an aluminum case, very good keyboard - especially for its size, attractive design (looks more expensive than it is), 3 USB ports (1 is 3.0), excellent sound from the speakers (surprisingly, the best I've heard - including from larger, more expensive laptops), a highly portable power adapter (no \"brick\") and a 500 GB hard drive that's more than sufficient.The downsides: The Intel i3 processor (1.8 GHz) is fast enough for anything I might do on this little computer, but folks who have very intensive computing needs will want a higher end, faster processor.  Again, for my needs, I haven't experienced any limitations, but I'm not running computer aided design software or creating animation...  Also, this unit comes with 4 GB RAM, which is not upgradeable.  Would you need more? I don't, but if you think you will, you need a higher end laptop with more RAM or at least expansion capability.  As for the screen, it is supposedly HD and I would describe it as \"decent,\" it is simply not the kind of ultra HD screen you will get on a $1500 laptop.  But then, if you want that level of resolution, you might also want a 13\" screen or larger so you can really enjoy the advantages. I find that the 11.6\" screen, while an upgrade for me personally from the 9 or 10 inch netbook screens, is still a bit smallish in terms of either serious movie watching or working for more than a few hours at a stretch. The battery life is unfortunately not in the realm of the little Asus netbooks with 6-cell batteries -- this unit has a 2-cell Lithium battery that is good only for 3 to 4 hours. It's also not easy to change it without unscrewing about 10 screws, so this unit will not provide those 6 or 7 hour marathons like the aforementioned netbooks. (If Asus were to come out with a replacement 4-cell battery for this unit, it would be a major upgrade! I'm going to keep my fingers crossed). Finally, I noted that some reviewers commented about the fan running frequently. I can tell you here and now that first of all, once I completed all of the Asus software updates, the fan seemed to run much less often. But regardless, the fan is very quiet. Unless you are working in a sound isolation chamber and are very distractable, believe me -- fan noise is not going to be an issue for you.The verdict: If you are comparing the Q200E to l1 or 13 inch laptops that cost $1000-$1500, you will find it lacking. No surprise!  However, if you are not a \"super user\" and evaluate this unit in terms of its $500 price tag, you will be pleased. I give it 4.5 stars!----------------------------------------------REVISED REVIEW -- 2 WEEKS LATER----------------------------------------------Well, I am revisiting this review because about 2 weeks after my original review (and only a month into owning this Asus), the hard drive failed. Up to that point, this little computer worked great -- just as I described above.  But one day, upon being shut down, the hard drive made some funny clicking noises.  I thought it was strange but paid no heed until the next day, when I tried to power it back on.  I could get only the system setup (Bios) screen, and nothing would work from there. Various tests returned messages about System Failure etc.  I called Asus technical support, and spent 35 minutes wasting my time with the protocol, only for the tech to conclude what I knew: the hard drive had failed.  He directed me back to BestBuy.  The technical guy at BestBuy examined the computer to make sure I hadn't tampered with it and he booted it up and checked it out.  Same conclusion.  Because it was so new, they actually offered me to exchange for a new one, or issue a refund.  My confidence in Asus a bit shaken, I took the refund.As a result of my experience, I'm knocking off a star.  But I'm not giving an even lower rating because every brand does experience a failure rate. The BestBuy tech told me that it was the first Asus of this type to come back; he noted another brand that he saw returned frequently for failed hard drives (I won't repeat the brand here, since this is basically hearsay).  He noted that his experience so far had been that this model Asus (and Asus in general) are quite reliable, but as he pointed out, if they make 100,000 of them and there's a 1% failure rate, that's still a 1000 defective units....So it might still be worth a try, despite my experience. This Asus seemed very solidly built and has a great form factor. It's too bad this happened but you might have better luck.  (I decided to go with a higher end Sony Vaio S series 13.3\", which was twice the price, but ultimately had some other features I wanted and stronger performance...so far so good with the Sony Vaio).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Very solid, all around travel companion; great value -- REVISED REVIEW", "unixReviewTime": 1356480000, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2012"}

Since new TV's have come down so much in price; it wasn't worth spending the money to fix it. I've been so pleased with the performance of our other Vizio TV's, that I decided to purchase this one.

Schmidt", "helpful": [20, 20], "reviewText": "I recently purchased an EVGA GTX 660 after reading good reviews about it.  I was very impressed with the results, and noticed a massive improvement over my PNY GTX 550 Ti 1GB.  I used my GTX 550 Ti for a build I was working on, and was disappointed with the temps I was reaching and the inability to play newer games on higher settings.  I enjoy tinkering with stuff a bit and most of the reviews I've read show the new Kepler powered GTX 650 ti is a pretty capable card, so I figured why not give it a shot.First I will point out, this card uses way less power than the Fermi based GTX 550 ti.  About 40W less power, which is significant considering theirs also a big boost in performance.  Another key advantage is this card is much smaller, about 2.5 inches less in length.  It's surprising because the next step up in the GTX 600 series is the 660, and that card is about 2 inches longer than the 550 ti, or nearly 4 inches longer than the 650 ti.  This makes the 650 ti ideal for those using small cases as it's small, cool, and uses little power (great for small PSU's in ITX setups).  I am using a Silverstone SG04 case with a front mounted radiator for the CPU cooler, so I was limited to cards less than 8 inches long for my case, the 650 ti fit with plenty of room to spare.  I think the other advantage this offers is it keeps the rest of the case fairly cool too as air flow is less restricted.I figured rather than talking about differences I noticed, I'd just run a 3D Passmark 11 and let the results speak for themselves.Setup:Silverstone SG04 mATX CaseSilverstone ST50F 500W PSUAsus P8Z77-IIntel Xeon E3 1230 v2Intel Liquid Thermal SolutionG.SKILL 2x8 (16GB) Ares DDR3 1600MHz RAMCrucial M4 SSD 64GB1st Test: PNY GTX 550 Ti 1GB2nd Test EVGA GTX 650 Ti 2GB SSCGTX 550 Ti Scores:E4582 / P2773 / X854GTX 650 Ti:E8067 / P5282 / X1603Frame rates were nearly double vs the 550 ti if not more in every benchmark test on 3D Mark 11.  The other important thing to note is that the EVGA GTX 550 Ti 2GB is still about $160.  If you're upgrading from a 550ti or 450 GTS, I think this card is definitely worth the price though I would recommend going with the GTX 660 if you can fit it, because that is a significant step up from the 650 ti for only $50 more.  The 650 ti walks all over the 550 ti, so if you're planning on buying the 550 ti don't even bother.Pros:FasterCoolerLess PowerSmallerCons:The GTX 650 Ti 2GB SSC is kinda pricy, AMD makes cards nearly as good for quite a bit cheaper, but they're also very large and use a lot of power.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good mid-range card", "unixReviewTime": 1351900800, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2012"}

Directions for installing the Kindle into the case were explicit except for one tiny item. You must make sure to slide the Kindle where the charging side is to the right. There is an open space on the case so the charging side is apparent. I slid the other side into the hard shell, and it was very difficult to remove the Kindle to change sides. The hard shell is just that and it took some strength to remove the Kindle. Once the Right side of the Kindle is in place, push down the left side into the hard shell until you hear it click. The Kindle is very secure! The directions for moving the Kindle to a vertical or horizontal view are explicit and easy. These features are excellent! There are small 'feet' that fit into the inner shell to secure the Kindle in the exact position you favor. The leather is well padded and quite attractive. There is an elastic strap to keep the cover closed. Like all good cases, this case turns the Kindle on when the cover is opened and turns the Kindle off when the cover is closed. There is also a small handle to carry the Kindle if needed.This case is an attractive, easy to use case.
